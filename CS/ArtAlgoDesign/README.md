## Notes on Algo design

```text
The Art of Algorithm Design is a complementary perception of all books on algorithm design and 
is a roadmap for all levels of learners as well as professionals dealing with algorithmic problems. 
Further, the book provides a comprehensive introduction to algorithms and covers them in considerable depth, 
yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. All algorithms are described and designed 
with a “pseudo-code” to be readable by anyone with little knowledge of programming.

This book comprises of a comprehensive set of problems and their solutions against each algorithm to demonstrate 
its executional assessment and complexity, with an objective to:

Understand the introductory concepts and design principles of algorithms and their complexities
Demonstrate the programming implementations of all the algorithms using C-Language
Be an excellent handbook on algorithms with self-explanatory chapters enriched with problems and solutions
While other books may also cover some of the same topics, this book is designed to be both versatile and complete as 
it traverses through step-by-step concepts and methods for analyzing each algorithmic complexity with pseudo-code examples. 
Moreover, the book provides an enjoyable primer to the field of algorithms.

This book is designed for undergraduates and postgraduates studying algorithm design.
