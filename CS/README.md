1. Algorithms and Data Structure:

Introduction to Algorithms by Rivest, Cormen, Stein, Leiserson, generally. It is also well known as CLRS book. You will find everything in this book about Algorithms. As the Algorithms are the core of the Computer Science Engineering, it would not be strange if call it as the bible for a CS engineer. Count it is in most recommended  books for CSE.

This book is recommended by the Quora CEO, Adam D’Angelo.

2. Operating System:

“Operating System Principles” by Galvin. It’s simple language and structure makes it easier to understand Operating System easily. Recommending you to Read semaphores well from this book.

If you want more  books for CSE, you can get OS book by Tanenbaum and OS book by Stallings. These are also the good books. These books area good for certain topics.

You can read other two books, but the first book is highly recommended.

3. Theory of Computation:

“Theory of Computation” by Ullman is the best among all other  books for CSE, to learn theory of computation. While reading this book you may come across many weird symbols involved, but no need to worry. If you read it with good concentration, you can catch up every point mentioned in the book.

There is one more book named “Introduction to the Theory of Computation” by Michael Sipser. This book is helpful for interviews preparation for MS/MTech admission.

4. Computer Networks:

“Computer Networks” by Tanenbaum is the first recommended  books for CSE preparation. There are lots of questions in this book that has been directly asked in previous  exam.

“Computer Networking: A top-down approach” by Kurose-Ross. It is another preferred choice.

There are also some other books for Computer Networks, authored by William Stallings and Behrouz Forouzan. It is useful for certain topics. Forouzan is written in the very easy language.

Go for Tanenbaum, read it wisely. Keep other books aside. If you get time then you can go for other  books for CSE.

10. Software Engineering:

“Software Engineering: A Practitioner’s Approach” by Pressman is the recommended book for CS  preparation. My personal advice, don’t read the complete book. Hardly 2-3 questions will come from this book, if you read this book completely it will take lots of time. There are very Few important concepts you must have to focus on like Cyclomatic Complexity, Coupling and Cohesion, etc. All the question will come from these topics only.
