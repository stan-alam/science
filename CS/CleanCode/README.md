**Clean Code -book 1, book 2**

Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftmanship
The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers
In Clean Code, legendary software expert Robert C. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer--but only if you work at it. You will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code and what’s wrong with it. More important, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.

 

In The Clean Coder, Martin introduces the disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of true software craftsmanship. This book is packed with practical advice--about everything from estimating and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique: It is about attitude. Martin shows how to approach software development with honor, self-respect, and pride; work well and work clean; communicate and estimate faithfully; face difficult decisions with clarity and honesty; and understand that deep knowledge comes with a responsibility to act.
