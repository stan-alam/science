## notes on The Elements of Computing Systems

```text
In the early days of computer science, the interactions of hardware, software,
compilers, and operating system were simple enough to allow students to see an
overall picture of how computers worked. With the increasing complexity of
computer technology and the resulting specialization of knowledge, such clarity
is often lost. Unlike other texts that cover only one aspect of the field, The
Elements of Computing Systems gives students an integrated and rigorous picture
of applied computer science, as its comes to play in the construction of a
simple yet powerful computer system.

Indeed, the best way to understand how computers work is to build one from
scratch, and this textbook leads students through twelve chapters and projects
that gradually build a basic hardware platform and a modern software hierarchy
from the ground up. In the process, the students gain hands-on knowledge of
hardware architecture, operating systems, programming languages, compilers,
data structures, algorithms, and software engineering. Using this constructive
approach, the book exposes a significant body of computer science knowledge
and demonstrates how theoretical and applied techniques taught in other courses
fit into the overall picture.

Designed to support one- or two-semester courses, the book is based on an
abstraction-implementation paradigm; each chapter presents a key hardware or
software abstraction, a proposed implementation that makes it concrete, and an
actual project. The emerging computer system can be built by following the
chapters, although this is only one option, since the projects are
self-contained and can be done or skipped in any order. All the computer
science knowledge necessary for completing the projects is embedded in the
book, the only pre-requisite being a programming experience.The bookâ€™s web
site provides all tools and materials necessary to build all the hardware
and software systems described in the text, including two hundred test programs
for the twelve projects. The projects and systems can be modified to meet
various teaching needs, and all the supplied software is open-source.
