## Software Mistakes and TradeOffs (notes)

```text
Optimize the decisions that define your code by exploring the common mistakes and intentional tradeoffs made by expert developers.

In Software Mistakes and Tradeoffs you will learn how to:

Reason about your systems to make intuitive and better design decisions
Understand consequences and how to balance tradeoffs
Pick the right library for your problem
Thoroughly analyze all of your service’s dependencies
Understand delivery semantics and how they influence distributed architecture
Design and execute performance tests to detect code hot paths and validate a system’s SLA
Detect and optimize hot paths in your code to focus optimization efforts on root causes
Decide on a suitable data model for date/time handling to avoid common (but subtle) mistakes
Reason about compatibility and versioning to prevent unexpected problems for API clients
Understand tight/loose coupling and how it influences coordination of work between teams
Clarify requirements until they are precise, easily implemented, and easily tested
Optimize your APIs for friendly user experience
Code performance versus simplicity. Delivery speed versus duplication. 
Flexibility versus maintainability—every decision you make in software engineering 
involves balancing tradeoffs. In Software Mistakes and Tradeoffs you’ll learn from costly 
mistakes that Tomasz Lelek and Jon Skeet have encountered over their impressive careers. 
You’ll explore real-world scenarios where poor understanding of tradeoffs lead to major 
problems down the road, so you can pre-empt your own mistakes with a more thoughtful 
approach to decision making.

Learn how code duplication impacts the coupling and evolution speed of your systems, 
and how simple-sounding requirements can have hidden nuances with respect to date and time 
information. Discover how to efficiently narrow your optimization scope according to 
80/20 Pareto principles, and ensure consistency in your distributed systems. 
You’ll soon have built up the kind of knowledge base that only comes from years of experience.

Every step in a software project involves making tradeoffs. 
When you’re balancing speed, security, cost, delivery time, features, and more, 
reasonable design choices may prove problematic in production. 
The expert insights and relatable war stories in this book will help 
you make good choices as you design and build applications.

Software Mistakes and Tradeoffs explores real-world scenarios where the wrong 
tradeoff decisions were made and illuminates what could have been done differently. In it, authors 
Tomasz Lelek and Jon Skeet share wisdom based on decades of software engineering experience, 
including some delightfully instructive mistakes. You’ll appreciate the specific tips and practical 
techniques that accompany each example, along with evergreen patterns that will change the way 
you approach your next projects.

How to reason about your software systematically
How to pick tools, libraries, and frameworks
How tight and loose coupling affect team coordination
Requirements that are precise, easy to implement, and easy to test
