Empower your team with platforms built on top of Kubernetes using open source tools.

Adopting Kubernetes is complex—especially when you’re working in an 
organization with multiple teams, deploying to multiple cloud providers, 
and working with different stacks. Platform Engineering on Kubernetes shows 
you how to solve these common cloud native problems with open-source tools and 
emerging best practices from the Kubernetes community.

In Platform Engineering on Kubernetes you will learn about:

The principles behind platform engineering and how these apply to Kubernetes
Evaluating and adopting open-source projects to build domain specific platforms
Creating Platform APIs to enable teams to release more software more efficiently
Reducing the cognitive load of a platform for your teams
Measuring your platform initiatives using established software delivery metrics
Package, version, distribute, and deploy with Helm, Tekton, Dagger and Argo CD
Implement a multi-cloud infrastructure strategy using Crossplane
Progressive upgrades with Knative Serving and Argo Rollouts
Enable development teams with standard application-level APIs with Dapr
A platform helps your team stay focused on delivering amazing software. 
But building a reliable platform on top of Kubernetes demands real expertise. 
Platform Engineering on Kubernetes reveals how to combine multiple popular 
open-source projects into a custom platform that works for your applications and your teams. 
It’s the perfect guide for your organization’s journey to Kubernetes, simplifying 
cloud native development for your dev teams and helping them deliver software faster.

Kubernetes is an amazing orchestration tool, but it’s just the start of your journey to the 
cloud. To efficiently deliver cloud-native software, your team needs a solid build pipeline, 
an efficient package manager and distribution mechanism, and APIs that reduce your team’s 
cognitive load. This book will show you how to build custom platforms on top of Kubernetes—all 
with open-source tools such as Dapr, Knative, Argo CD and Rollouts, and Tekton.

Platform Engineering on Kubernetes starts by clearly defining the elements of a great 
Kubernetes-based platform. Then, it systematically introduces the tools you’ll need to build 
a platform that exactly matches your organization’s requirements. Hands-on examples and 
detailed code guide you through each step. By the end, you’ll be able to create a 
complete platform to efficiently deliver cloud-native software without being tied 
to a specific cloud provider or vendor.
