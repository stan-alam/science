Book depth well be a long interesting read. I lived in the middle of all the great incite to the behind the seen descriptions. See how technology change challenged management and marketing as a factor in Industrial revolution. IBM's initiation and survival based on Respect For The Individual and Customer Service. My career changed multiple times by mutual agreement. I don't know where else you could get such challenge, job satisfaction and accomplishment over 30 years employment. Thank you for your book's documentary work.

A Complete Review of IBM's History of Rise, Falls and Reinventions
By Peter E. Greulich on Mar 12, 2019
Jim's book is a great documentary from a former employee and one of IBM's most knowledgeable historians. I tag the pages or ideas in a book that I consider worth rereading and thinking about later. Hopefully the uploaded picture is worth more than the 1,000 words I am going to write here. All IBMers should understand when I say it is a "1" performer or a "5" under Amazon's rating system.

I found the read compelling because:

(1) It covers the history of IBM from its earliest of dates through 2018 which more historians should attempt to accomplish to put today's IBM in perspective for a new generation that has little context of its history of falls and recoveries.

(2) It provides a new look at all of IBM's Chief Executives. It raises the esteem that historians should carry for Frank T Cary's leadership in the '70s and lowers the leadership value of John R. Opel's in the '80s. Views I agree with and think more historians should consider in their reviews.

(3) Looks at Louis V. Gerstner with not as much new eyes as at least a look outside the self-evaluation the chief executive wrote of himself in "Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?" In this area, I look forward to further works from Jim as he consolidates more facts that were not in Lou's or this book: (1) that Lou Gerstner never had to lead though a major economic downturn (coming on board as one ended and announcing his retirement as one began), (2) the contradiction between telling employees there was an on-going financial crisis as he stripped them of their benefits but started stock buybacks in 1995, yearly dividend increases in 1996 and two stock splits in 1997 and 1999, and (3) hopefully, a new round of books that are, as Jim points out, sorely lacking from Lou's top lieutenants as they evaluate his leadership. Historians sorely need these views when these executives can write them with the distance of time. Jim does a great job looking at this time frame ... I just think there is more to the story, just like there is to Frank Cary's and John Opel's that the distance of time will bring into clarity. This is a good start, there is just more to come.

Comments to enjoy this book:

(1) I read the book like a historian from front to back following its chronological order. Jim in the book recommends starting where you have the most interest. I too would recommend this to the non-historian reader. Jump around and start with what is most relevant to you today.

(2) It is a book targeted to historians also. Because of this a casual reader may find the references to all the other historian's views on IBM and corporate history a little distracting. Just read faster through these parts ... a 700 page book should be written to satisfy the needs of multiple audiences. If you are a historian attempting to pull together a multitude of eclectic views of the company, ideas on leadership and reviews of strategies, these are the places to slow down and think a little harder; if not, skim and don't get hung up on it.

(3) If you are an employee that has been resourced by the 21st Century IBM you may find the view of the current day IBM a little on the positive side. Although empathetic with the current employee situation, the distance of the historian - to me - is a little too distant; but this should be interpreted as a challenge to "my" views - a great book does such things, doesn't it? It should make us feel a little uncomfortable with our own thoughts?

A great read and amazing effort Jim - thank you.

Cheers,

- Pete

That source of revenue was like Kodak making its cameras available but generating greater profits from selling film, or Gillette profiting from its safety razor by supplying blades. Like film and blades, Hollerith’s cards were more profitable than rental income from hardware. Card revenue came in immediately, whereas lease revenue accrued over many years.

This practice continued until the 1990s. Patterson, by contrast, was simply cruel. He was famous for cleaning out someone’s office and putting a new name on the door without informing the executive that he had been fired. One fired executive found his desk on fire on the front lawn of corporate headquarters. That was not Watson’s style.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Watson and Flint had already negotiated salary and profit-sharing terms. Because his original contract with C-T-R included provisions for sharing profits—not just stock and salary—when IBM became a large firm, he became one of the richest men in America.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

For example, if a machine rented for $200 per month, it was worth 200 points to a salesman. He was expected to keep that 200 points installed, and if it was replaced, it would ideally be with a machine that rented for more than $200 per month, or more than 200 points, because his quota was set in points that he was to add to the “install base” of points. If the salesman was assigned a quota of 200 points, and what was already installed was 1,000 points, he would be expected in the course of the year to “grow the account” by 200 points so that at the end of the year his customer was spending $1,200 per month,                                                                                                                                             |

But they were not alone. C-T-R/IBM cumulatively acquired over 1,200 patents between 1911 and 1940, and another 900 by 1950.29 The bulk of IBM’s patents came between 1926 and 1940, when 969 were granted, but it took a long time for ideas and then patents to emerge as products, a process that Watson and his executive team understood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Third, the equipment had to perform functions that made sense to a customer, which is why accounting, census taking, and inventory control attracted early users.31 Fourth, a customer had to have a capable staff. These included keypunch operators, others who could use peripheral equipment and “program” tabulators to do their bidding, and still others to manage the flow of cards coming in and out of a data processing center and to deliver reports to where they were needed according to some fixed schedule.                                                                                       |

Economies on both sides of the Atlantic did not recover for a long time: the United States did not recover until it engaged in World War II. Europe went directly from depression into such a destructive world war that it did not achieve economic prosperity again until the early 1950s.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
