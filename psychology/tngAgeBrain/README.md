## notes on the Teenage Brain

Drawing on her research knowledge and clinical experience, internationally respected neurologist�and mother of two boys�Frances E. Jensen, M.D., offers a revolutionary look at the science of the adolescent brain, providing remarkable insights that translate into practical advice for both parents and teenagers.

Driven by the assumption that brain growth was pretty much complete by the time a child began kindergarten, scientists believed for years that the adolescent brain was essentially an adult one�only with fewer miles on it. Over the last decade, however, the scientific community has learned that the teen years encompass vitally important stages of brain development.

Motivated by her personal experience of parenting two teenage boys, renowned neurologist Dr. Frances E. Jensen gathers what we�ve discovered about adolescent brain functioning, wiring, and capacity and, in this groundbreaking, accessible book, explains how these eye-opening findings not only dispel commonly held myths about the teenage years, but also yield practical suggestions that will help adults and teenagers negotiate the mysterious world of adolescent neurobiology.

Interweaving clear summary and analysis of research data with anecdotes drawn from her years as a parent, clinician, and public speaker, Dr. Jensen explores adolescent brain functioning and development in the contexts of learning and multitasking, stress and memory, sleep, addiction, and decision-making.

Rigorous yet accessible, warm yet direct, The Teenage Brain sheds new light on the brains�and behaviors�of adolescents and young adults, and analyzes this knowledge to share specific ways in which parents, educators, and even the legal system can help them navigate their way more smoothly into adulthood.

"But my sweet-natured firstborn son had suddenly become unfamiliar, unpredictable, and bent on being different. He had just     transferred from a very conventional middle school that went through ninth grade, where jackets and ties were the norm, to a very progressive high school. Upon arriving, he took full advantage of the new environment, and part of that was to dress in what you might describe as an “alternative” style. Let’s face it, his best friend had spiky blue hair."

"At least he felt comfortable enough to tell me about something he wanted to do before he actually did it. This was an opportunity, I realized, and I quickly seized it. Instead of damaging your hair with some cheap, over-the-counter dye, what if I take you to my hair guy for the red streaks? I asked him. Since I also was going to pay for it, Andrew happily agreed. My hair stylist, who was a sort of punk rocker himself, got totally into the task. He did a great job, actually—so good that Andrew’s girlfriend at the time was inspired to color her hair in exactly the same black-and-red motif. She attempted this herself, and needless to say had different results."

"back then is the breathtaking range of dangers teens would be exposed to today through social media and the Internet. How many times have I heard from friends, colleagues, even strangers who have reached out to me after hearing me speak, about the crazy things their teenage kids or their friends just did? The daughter who “stole” her father’s motorcycle and crashed it into a curb. The kids who went “planking”—lying facedown, like a board, on any and every surface (including balcony railings), and then taking photos of one another doing it. Or worse: “vodka eyeballing,” pouring liquor directly into the eye to get an immediate high, or, scared about passing a drug test for a weekend     job, ingesting watered-down bleach, thinking it would “clean” their urine of the pot they had smoked the night before."

"learning is cumulative—everything new is based on something you just learned, so you have to hang in there, you have to stay on top of it. So I got a pad of paper and I went through each chapter of Andrew’s textbooks, and on one side of the paper I picked out a problem for him to solve and on the other side, folded, was the answer. All he needed was a model, a template, a structure. It was a turning point for him and me. He realized he actually had to do the work—sit down and do it—in order to learn. He also realized working on his bed, with everything spread out around him, wasn’t helping. He needed more structure, so he sat himself at his desk, with a pencil sharpener and a piece of paper in front of him, and he learned how to impose order on himself. He needed the external cues."

"Let them experiment with these more harmless things rather than have them rebel and get into much more serious trouble.

"the impression you give others in these encounters can affect the direction your career takes; this is why it’s so important to plan ahead, at least for more than just a few minutes, and think about how the other person will react during one of these meetings. In your mind, go through what you want to say, step by step, and imagine the range of responses. Now imagine that the other person is your teenage son or daughter. Being prepared for both positive and negative responses will help guide you as you consider your options"

"Mostly for economic reasons, children were considered mini-adults well into the nineteenth century. They were needed to sow the fields, milk the cows, and split the firewood. By the time of the American Revolution half the population of the new colonies was under the age of sixteen. If a girl was still single at eighteen, she was considered virtually unmarriageable."

"A few years ago, researchers discovered that puberty is initiated by what appears to be a game of hormonal dominoes, which begins with a gene producing a single protein, named"

"kisspeptin, in the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that regulates metabolism. When that protein connects with, or “kisses,” receptors on another gene, it eventually triggers the pituitary gland to release its storage of hormones. Those surges of testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone in turn activate the testes and ovaries."

"teenagers don’t have higher hormone levels than young adults—they just react differently to hormones. For instance, adolescence is a time     of increased response to stress, which may in part be why anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, typically arise during puberty. Teens simply don’t have the same tolerance for stress that we see in adults."

"In 2007, researchers at the State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center reported that the hormone tetrahydropregnanolone (THP), usually released in response to stress to modulate anxiety, has a reverse effect in adolescents, raising anxiety instead of tamping it down. In an adult, this stress hormone acts like a tranquilizer"

"especially neurotransmitters, the brain’s “messengers,” are in flux. This is why adolescence is a time of true wonder. Because of the flexibility and growth of the brain, adolescents have a window of opportunity with an increased capacity for remarkable accomplishments. But flexibility, growth, and exuberance are a double-edged sword because an “open” and excitable brain also can be adversely affected by stress, drugs, chemical substances, and any number of changes in the environment."

"Among all the organs of the human body, the brain is the most incomplete structure at birth, just about 40 percent the size it will be in adulthood. Size is not the only thing that changes; all the internal wiring changes during development. Brain growth, it turns out, takes a lot of time."

"We assume when someone looks like an adult that he or she must be one mentally as well. Adolescent boys shave and teenage girls can get pregnant, and yet neurologically neither one has a brain ready for prime time: the adult world."

"Dwarf monkeys have one gram of brain matter for every twenty-seven grams of body matter, and yet the ratio for humans is one gram of brain weight to forty-four grams of body weight. So we actually have less brain per gram of body weight than some of our primate cousins. It is the complexity of the way neurons are hooked up to one another that matters."

"The temporal lobes include areas involved in the regulation of emotions and sexuality. Language is also located here, more specifically in the dominant hemisphere (the left temporal lobe for right-handed people and 85 percent of left-handed people, and the right temporal lobe for that small group of truly strong lefties)."

"    as the brain matures from back to front in the teen years the frontal lobes are the least mature and the least connected compared with the other lobes."

"A dog has a billion olfactory cells in its brain compared with our measly twelve million. And the shark has special cells in its brain that help it detect electrical fields—not to navigate but to pick up electrical signals given off by the scantest of muscle movements in other fish as they try to hide from this deadly predator."

"That 20 percent gap, where the wiring is thinnest, is crucial and goes a long way toward explaining why teenagers behave in such puzzling ways—their mood swings, irritability, impulsiveness, and explosiveness; their inability to focus, to follow through, and to connect with adults; and their temptations to use drugs and alcohol and to engage in other risky behavior."

Stanislaw:

"    One of the reasons that repetition is so important lies in your teenager’s brain development. One of the frontal lobes’ executive functions includes something called prospective memory, which is the ability to hold in your mind the intention to perform a certain action at a future time—for instance, remembering to return a phone call when you get home from work. Researchers have found not only that prospective memory is very much associated with the frontal lobes but also that it continues to develop and become more efficient specifically between the ages of six and ten, and then again in the twenties."

Stanislaw:

"The parietal lobes, located just behind the frontal lobes, contain association areas and are crucial to being able to switch between tasks, something that also matures late in the adolescent brain. Switching between tasks is nearly a constant need in today’s world of information overload, especially when you consider the fact that multitasking—doing two cognitively complex things at the same time—is actually a myth. Chewing gum and doing virtually anything else is not multitasking because chewing gum involves no real cognitive focus. Both talking on a cell phone and driving, however, do involve cognitive focus."

"Multitasking is not only a myth but a dangerous one, especially when it comes to the teenage brain. “Multitasking” has become a household word. The research in Sweden suggests that there are limits. Teenagers and young adults     pride themselves on their ability to multitask. Have today’s teens and young adults imprinted on a multitasking world?"

"immature amygdala is thought to contribute to adolescent explosiveness; this explains in part the hysteria that greets parents when they say no to whatever it is their adolescent thinks is a perfectly reasonable request. Cross that immature amygdala with a teen’s loosely connected frontal lobe, and you have a recipe for potential disaster. For example, the sixteen-year-old patient of a colleague of mine was so incensed when his parents said driving was a “privilege” (for which he did not yet qualify), and not a “right,” that he stole the car keys and drove away from the house. He didn’t get very far, though. He forgot the garage door was closed and plowed right through it."
