## Workspace for notes on the 'The Neuroscientist Who Lost Her Mind.'

```text
In January 2015, Barbara Lipska—a leading expert on the neuroscience of mental
illness—was diagnosed with melanoma that had spread to her brain. Within months,
her frontal lobe, the seat of cognition, began shutting down. She descended
into madness, exhibiting dementia- and schizophrenia-like symptoms that
terrified her family and coworkers. But miraculously, just as her doctors
figured out what was happening, the immunotherapy they had prescribed began
to work. Just eight weeks after her nightmare began, Lipska returned to normal.
With one difference: she remembered her brush with madness with exquisite clarity.
In The Neuroscientist Who Lost Her Mind, Lipska describes her extraordinary
ordeal and its lessons about the mind and brain.

**She explains how mental illness, brain injury, and age can change our behavior,
personality, cognition, and memory. She tells what it is like to experience
these changes firsthand. And she reveals what parts of us remain, even when
so much else is gone.**
