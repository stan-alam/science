Review
Advance Praise for Good Reasons for Bad Feelings

"To quote a renowned geneticist, 'Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.'  
A quarter century ago, Randolph Nesse bravely helped apply this dictum to medicine.  
Now, in Good Reasons For Bad Feelings, he tackles the deeper evolutionary question of why
we, our minds, and our brains are so vulnerable to mental illness.  He navigates the dangers of
either too much or too little adaptationism, deftly handles the false dichotomy between psychological and
biological perspectives, and bridges abstract intellectualizing with pressing clinical need.  
This is a wise, accessible, highly readable exploration of an issue that goes to the heart
of human existence."
--Robert M. Sapolsky, author of Behave

"An ingenious exploration of how Darwinian evolution explains mental disorders."
--Kirkus Reviews (starred review)

“Nesse (Why We Get Sick), director of the Center for Evolutionary Medicine at
Arizona State University, thought-provokingly comments on modern medicine’s
continuing difficulties in treating mental illness… Nesse fully meets his modest
but laudable goal of providing a conversation-starter on why mental illness
should be viewed from an evolutionary perspective.”
--Publishers Weekly

“Those powerful feelings that fill our day, that give us the oomph to act one
way or another are the guardrails to living and this wonderful books explains all of them.  
Randolph Nesse has done it again.”
--Michael S. Gazzaniga, Director, Sage Center, UC Santa Barbara, author of Tales
from Both Sides of the Brain

“Randolph Nesse is one of the key architects of evolutionary medicine. He's been
an inspiration to a generation of scientists who explore evolution to understand
why we get sick from diseases ranging from cancer to obesity to infectious diseases.
Now Nesse has turned his attention from the body to the mind, in a provocative book
full of intriguing explanations about human nature in all its strengths and weaknesses.”

--Carl Zimmer, author of She Has Her Mother's Laugh: The Powers, Perversions, and Potential of Heredity

“A book as wise and illuminating as it is relevant to our daily lives."
--Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, Professor Emerita of Anthropology, UC Davis, author of
The Woman that Never Evolved and Mother Nature

"Randolph Nesse, who trained psychiatrists for many years, has for a quarter
century been a key leader of evolutionary medicine. Good Reasons for Bad Feelings
integrates these two strands of his life and thought in a readable, insightful book,
as much a philosophy of emotions as it is a new window on mental illness. All who want
to know themselves should read it."
--Melvin Konner, Dobbs Professor of Anthropology, Emory University, author of The Tangled Wing

“Clear and engaging, and the narrative reflects a masterful blend of history, novel
ideas, and clinical experience in an insightful and coherent manner. I hope it is
widely read and discussed."
--Eric Charnov, Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Evolutionary Ecology,
University of Utah, MacArthur Fellow

“This will become a treasured classic; not just for clinicians but for all those
interested in how to facilitate well-being and create more moral communities and societies."
--Professor Paul Gilbert OBE, author of Compassionate Mind, and Living like Crazy

"'Why am I feeling bad?' This is the first burning question of everyone who suffers.
This accessible new book will be an essential tool to help patients, their loved ones,
and treating professionals arrive at more satisfying answers."
--Jonathan Rottenberg, Professor of Psychology, University of South Florida, author of The Depths

"A bold book that would have made Darwin proud. Cutting-edge and compassionate at the same time."
--Lee Dugatkin, Professor of Biology, University of Louisville, co-author of How to Tame a Fox and Build a Dog

“A masterful, groundbreaking book that persuasively challenges standard clinical
wisdom and provides a roadmap for the transformation of our conceptually confused
psychiatric nosology. With crystal clarity, Nesse reviews what we know of our
biologically designed emotions and argues for unflinching acceptance of our evolved
nature as a baseline for understanding both normal and disordered suffering...
Anyone interested in mental health—laypeople, students, clinicians, and scholars—will
be grateful for the novel insights to be gained from this important book.”
--Jerome C. Wakefield, Professor of Psychiatry, New York University, co-author of
The Loss of Sadness

"What is the nature of suffering, its origin and its adaptive significance? Good
Reasons for Bad Feelings may well become a legend, as it is a book about psychology,
psychiatry, biology and philosophy that is also a good read, and it opens the door to
deep questions in a manner that is tender, quizzical, and industrious."
--Judith Eve Lipton, MD, co-author of Strength Through Peace

"Very engagingly written for the general reader, Nesse's book is hugely important for
the future of mental health care, and Nesse is the pre-eminent person to write it.
It provides a personalized and lively but well documented treatise on how we humans
function as we do and on needed changes in the way psychiatry thinks about troublesome
mental experiences and behavior. It draws on an impressive range of knowledge, from not
only psychiatry, including extensive case descriptions, but also psychology, biology,
philosophy, and humanistic literature. Many readers will find it hard to put the book down."
--Eric Klinger, Emeritus Professor of Psychology, University of Minnesota

"Two sets of ideas inform this fine book: one, the cold-hearted logic of natural selection;
the other, the practical wisdom of a compassionate psychiatrist. The tension is palpable. The result is riveting."
--Nicholas Humphrey, Emeritus Professor of Psychology, London School of Economics, author of Soul Dust

"Good Reasons for Bad Feelings by Randy Nesse is a delightful book. It is insightful about the
human condition, sanguine and not over-stated. And it is written in a straight-forward and
delightful manner, personal and professional, and with humor. Neese is one of the originators
of the field of evolutionary medicine. This is a welcome book in evolutionary psychiatry and on the
biological basis of the emotions and our cultural evolution."
--Jay Schulkin, Research Professor of Neuroscience, Georgetown University

"In Good Reasons for Bad Feelings, leading evolutionary theorist, psychiatrist Randolph Nesse,
begs us to ask the right question: Why did natural selection make us so prone to mental disorders of
so many kinds and intensities?  It is no exaggeration to say that he opens the door to a new paradigm in
thinking about human beings and their conflicted lives.  A pathbreaking book by a man who is truly humane and caring.  
A privilege to share time with him."
--Michael Ruse, Werkmeister Professor of Philosophy, Florida State University, author of On Purpose

"How did we end up recognizing that every system in the body has a function shaped by
evolutionary selection and yet thinking that systems in the mind do not? How did physical
and mental health drift so far apart? Randolph Nesse explains, in this highly readable book,
how 'symptoms' in psychiatry should be seen in their evolutionary context, and that anxiety and
depression for example have functions, just as do inflammation, blood clotting, or a cough.
Nesse is a pioneer of evolutionary psychiatry, which has the potential to revolutionize mental
health care."
--Simon Baron-Cohen, Professor of Developmental Psychopathology, Cambridge University

"This book sets out to show how evolution underpins (or should underpin) psychiatry.
In doing so, it will surely change the face of medicine -- and deservedly so."
--Robin Dunbar, Emeritus Professor of Evolutionary Psychology, University of Oxford

"Randy Nesse has brought a new and important synthesis to the study of illnesses
that psychiatrists deal in. This engagingly accessible, pioneering book provides a
wide range of answers for how something as maladaptive as bipolar disorders could
have evolved. It provides a wide range of answers for why natural selection has left
us vulnerable to so many mental disorders, and the “mystery of missing heredity” is
identified as a key problem. Nesse shows that by taking into account complex pleiotropic
effects, natural selection may push some useful trait close to a fitness peak near a
"cliff edge" despite the disabling consequences for a few individuals who go over the
edge. Thus a gene may be useful to many, but with bad luck contribute to victimizing the
few. This complex problem surely will yield to further research."
--Christopher Boehm, Professor of Biological Sciences, USC Dornsife
