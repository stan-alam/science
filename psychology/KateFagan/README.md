Her friends and peers were stunned, several commenting in their confusion that her life was “perfect.” Not seemed but was perfect, as evidenced by the beautifully curated Instagram feed to which she frequently posted, documenting each wonderful moment after the next.

And now here is her fuller story, along with the personal essays and explorations around mental illness that Kate has so thoughtfully crafted in the months since that original publication. It is a powerful and moving work, and one that espnW is honored to have played a role in developing and supporting. It will start conversations—important conversations—about athletes, yes, but more than that, about young people who struggle. With pressure. With illness. With life.                                                                  |

Just months ago, she was winning the 800 meters at the New Jersey State Championships, anticipation in the air, the stands filled with a rainbow of school colors, Maddy powering through the finish line as if she could have done yet another lap. In high school, when a practice was too easy, she would come home and run circles around their backyard, actually creating a visible path in the grass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

She mentioned to Emma that perhaps she would try transferring to Wharton, Penn’s famed business school. “Really, she was confused as to what she wanted to do,” Emma said. “She honestly didn’t know. She liked writing, and I remember her saying maybe she could be a writer later on. But she knew it was hard to graduate from college and write. ‘If I go to business school,’ she told me, ‘that would be more practical.’ I think I could see her in communications, in public relations, for sure—something with fashion or social media. I know she would be smart enough for business, but she didn’t love it.”|

I have battled everyday anxiety on occasions too numerous to count, whether before speaking in public, before going on TV, before offering an opinion in meetings. Yet during each of these occasions I understood, even as the weight of the fear commandeered a good portion of my brain and body, that the panic was temporary, circumstantial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |      |

I tried breathing deeply, but my mind continued churning: What’s the point of all this? Who am I now? What does my future hold? Am I alone in the world? Will I always be alone? Aren’t we all, essentially, alone? I actually started talking aloud to myself, telling myself to calm down, that it would pass.                                                                                                          |      |
