## The New ChildHood

```text
In The New Childhood, Jordan Shapiro provides a hopeful counterpoint to the fearful
hand-wringing that has come to define our narrative around children and technology.
Drawing on groundbreaking research in economics, psychology, philosophy, and education,
The New Childhood shows how technology is guiding humanity toward a bright future in
which our children will be able to create new, better models of global citizenship,
connection, and community.

Shapiro offers concrete, practical advice on how to parent and educate children effectively
in a connected world, and provides tools and techniques for using technology to engage with
kids and help them learn and grow. He compares this moment in time to other great
technological revolutions in humanity’s past and presents entertaining micro-histories
of cultural fixtures: the sandbox, finger painting, the family dinner, and more.
But most importantly, The New Childhood paints a timely, inspiring and positive picture
of today’s children, recognizing that they are poised to create a progressive, diverse,
meaningful, and hyper-connected world that today’s adults can only barely imagine.
