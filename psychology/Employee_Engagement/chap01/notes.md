## Only 30% of employees are engaged at work 
Gallup pole : 2012

## If you care, you can drive engagement. 

## What is employee engagement?

## Engagement does not mean happy. 

Someone might be happy at work, but this does not mean they are productive. **Engaged does not mean satisfied** SOmeone can be satified at work but only statified enough to be clock-watching nine-to-fiver. **They can be satified but will still take another job for a 5% pay bump**.

# Employee engagement is the emotional commitment an employee has to the organization and its goals!

**engaged employees** *care* **about their work**.
They are not doing it because they have to, or because just a paycheck, or even for getting a promotion. 

	When employees care, when they are engaged they use discretionary effort, they go the extra mile:
    
**An engaged software engineer will leave code cleaner than when was she was given it**.

**10:62:2 Rule** states that ever 10% improvement in commitment increases employee effort by 6% and every 6% increase in effort increases performance by 2%

Discretionary effort employees stay longer and are not impacted as much by recruiters luring them to higher pay.
