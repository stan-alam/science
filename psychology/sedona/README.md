## notes on 'Sedona Method'

```text
I have been hearing wonderful things about the Sedona Method® from clients and
friends for about 20 years. Recently, I finally took the course with my wife and
my 12-year-old son. I’ve been amazed at the simplicity of the Method and the
powerful impact it has had on my life. Through my work with Chicken Soup for
the Soul and through Self-Esteem Seminars, I have been exposed to many self-improvement
techniques and processes. This one stands head and shoulders above the rest for the ease
of its use, its profound impact and the speed it produces results. The Sedona Method is
a vastly accelerated way of letting go of feelings like anger, frustration, jealousy,
anxiety, stress and fear as well as many other problems—even physical pain—with which
almost everybody struggles at one time or another. One of the wonderful byproducts of
taking the seminar is that I have become friends with Hale Dwoskin. He is one of the
calmest, clearest, most joy-filled people I have ever met, living proof that the
Sedona Method works wonders. I am ecstatic about our friendship. During the seminar, I
found myself constantly in awe of Hale’s brilliant teaching style. I experienced one
breakthrough after another. As a result, I’ve already referred many family members,
friends, and business associates to the Sedona Method seminars, and I’ve also had the
entire staff at Chicken Soup for the Soul Enterprises learn the Method through the
audio programs that Hale put together. Now I am thoroughly delighted to be able to
recommend The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace, and Well-being.
Reading this book is the equivalent of taking the Sedona Method Basic Course and several
Advanced Courses rolled together. Filled with practical techniques and enlightening true
stories, Hale clearly and generously explains everything we need to know to master the
releasing process and to continue using the Method day by day, moment by moment in real
life situations, such as having more fulfilling and harmonious relationships, building
financial security, developing satisfying careers, breaking nasty habits, losing weight,
and enjoying good health. He reveals the Sedona Method’s powerful secret for manifesting
what you want in your life, while showing you how to be at ease and comfortable with what
you already have. The Method also enables you how to have greater ease, enjoyment and
peace of mind with all that you experience on a daily basis.
