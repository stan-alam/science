1: Start Small "Atomic Habits" emphasizes the power of starting small when it comes to building good habits or 
breaking bad ones. By focusing on tiny, incremental changes, we can make progress over time without feeling overwhelmed. 
Small habits compound and create significant transformations in our lives.


2: Make Habits Obvious Clear teaches us that making habits obvious is crucial for their formation. 
By creating visible cues and reminders in our environment, we increase the likelihood of performing the desired habit. 
This could involve placing items in plain sight or setting up visual cues to trigger the habit.

3: Harness the Power of Habit Stacking Habit stacking is the practice of linking new habits to existing ones. By 
piggybacking off established routines, we make it easier to incorporate new habits into our daily lives. This 
strategy helps us leverage existing habits' power and creates a seamless transition into new behaviors.

4: Employ the Two-Minute Rule The two-minute rule suggests that we should aim to start new habits in under 
two minutes. By lowering the activation energy needed to initiate a habit, we overcome the initial resistance 
and make it easier to get started. This approach helps build momentum and increases the likelihood of habit formation.

5: Focus on Identity and Identity-Based Habits Clear highlights that focusing on our identity is key to long-lasting 
habit change. By aligning our habits with our desired identity, we increase our commitment and motivation to stick with 
them. Shifting our self-perception and embracing identity-based habits helps us embody the person we want to become.

6: Embrace the Power of Habit Tracking Tracking our habits is a powerful tool for self-awareness and accountability. 
By monitoring our progress, we gain insights into our habits' effectiveness and our overall behavior. Habit tracking
helps us identify patterns, adjust our strategies, and stay motivated on our journey of habit formation.

7: Emphasize Continuous Improvement "Atomic Habits" emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement in our habits. 
By focusing on consistent, incremental progress, we can achieve remarkable results over time. Embracing a growth mindset 
and constantly refining our habits enables us to adapt, learn, and thrive.
