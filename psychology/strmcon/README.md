## notes on 'The River of Consciousness'

```text
Oliver Sacks, a scientist and a storyteller, is beloved by readers for the extraordinary
neurological case histories (Awakenings, An Anthropologist on Mars) in which he
introduced and explored many now familiar disorders–autism, Tourette’s syndrome,
face blindness, savant syndrome. He was also a memoirist who wrote with honesty
and humor about the remarkable and strange encounters and experiences that shaped
him (Uncle Tungsten, On the Move, Gratitude). Sacks, an Oxford-educated polymath,
had a deep familiarity not only with literature and medicine but with botany,
animal anatomy, chemistry, the history of science, philosophy, and psychology.
The River of Consciousness is one of two books Sacks was working on up to his
death, and it reveals his ability to make unexpected connections, his
sheer joy in knowledge, and his unceasing, timeless project to understand what makes us human.
