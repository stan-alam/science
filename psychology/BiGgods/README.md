Watched people are nice people. 2. Religion is more in the situation than in the person. 3. Hell is stronger than heaven. 4. Trust people who trust in God. 5. Religious actions speak louder than words. 6. Unworshipped Gods are impotent Gods. 7. Big Gods for Big Groups. 8. Religious groups cooperate in order to compete.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It creates opportunities for people to freeride on their punishment duties.16 One solution to this problem, of course, is third-party punishment—that is, policing institutions. A study done in Switzerland, for example, found that in cantons with genetically homogenous populations, where kinship ties are strong, people rely on the police less. However, in cantons with greater genetic diversity, reliance on police increases, exactly as would be expected if                                                           |

These intuitions support widely held religious beliefs and related practices, such as gods, spirits, and souls of various types and characteristics.27 Once that happened, the stage was set for rapid cultural evolution—nongenetic, socially transmitted changes in beliefs and behaviors—that eventually led to large societies with Big Gods.                                                                  |

A cauldron of water was boiled, and a piece of red-hot iron rod or burning stone thrown into it. The accused was then commanded to prepare to insert her hand and arm into the boiling water and retrieve it. If her flesh was unscathed, she was declared innocent. Otherwise, she was guilty. In another variant, the naked, bound defendant was thrown into a deep pool of holy water. If the defendant sank, he was condemned. If he floated, he was a free man.

When people want to appease ancestor spirits, they worry that the spirits might get angry and vengeful if proper ritual sacrifices are not conducted to honor them. In Hindu mythology, the rocky relationship between Lord Shiva and his divine consort Shakti includes enough mind-twisting gossip to challenge even the most sophisticated mind reader.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Mind-body dualism is a naturally developing intuition that supports many religious beliefs. It is this intuition that gives rise to the pervasive belief in disembodied supernatural agents such as gods, souls, and spirits, who are believed to possess human-like mind stuff—beliefs, desires, emotions—allowing believers to have a personal relationship with God or other supernatural beings.4                                                                                                                                                                                             |

There is evidence that science education, far from rooting out these intuitions, merely suppresses them. For example, even professional scientists slip into teleological thinking when under time pressure. Many of these insights come from the work of psychologist Deborah Kelemen, who has studied teleological thinking in adults and children. She calls this phenomenon “intuitive theism,” because it seems to prepare our minds for creationist thinking: if all things were designed for a purpose, doesn’t it make sense that there is a creator who designed them?6                                 |
