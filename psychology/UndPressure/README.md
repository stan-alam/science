## notes on Under Pressure

```text
An urgently needed guide to the alarming increase in anxiety and stress experienced by
girls from elementary school through college, from the New York Times bestselling author of Untangled

“An invaluable read for anyone who has girls, works with girls, or cares about girls—for everyone!”—Claire Shipman,
author of The Confidence Code and The Confidence Code for Girls

Though anxiety has risen among young people overall, studies confirm that it has skyrocketed in girls.
Research finds that the number of girls who said that they often felt nervous, worried, or fearful jumped
55 percent from 2009 to 2014, while the comparable number for adolescent boys has remained unchanged.
As a clinical psychologist who specializes in working with girls, Lisa Damour, Ph.D., has witnessed
this rising tide of stress and anxiety in her own research, in private practice, and in the all-girls’
school where she consults. She knew this had to be the topic of her new book.

In the engaging, anecdotal style and reassuring tone that won over thousands of readers of her first
book, Untangled, Damour starts by addressing the facts about psychological pressure. She explains the
surprising and underappreciated value of stress and anxiety: that stress can helpfully stretch us
beyond our comfort zones, and anxiety can play a key role in keeping girls safe. When we emphasize
the benefits of stress and anxiety, we can help our daughters take them in stride.

But no parents want their daughter to suffer from emotional overload, so Damour then turns to the
many facets of girls’ lives where tension takes hold: their interactions at home, pressures at school,
social anxiety among other girls and among boys, and their lives online. As readers move through the
layers of girls’ lives, they’ll learn about the critical steps that adults can take to shield their
daughters from the toxic pressures to which our culture—including we, as parents—subjects girls.

Readers who know Damour from Untangled or the New York Times, or from her regular appearances on
CBS News, will be drawn to this important new contribution to understanding and supporting today’s girls.

Advance praise for Under Pressure

“Truly a must-read for parents, teachers, coaches, and mentors wanting to help girls along the path
to adulthood.”—Julie Lythcott-Haims, New York Times bestselling author of How to Raise an Adult

Lisa Damour offers a fresh, riveting take on the unsustainable stress girls face today, which is often
fueled unintentionally by the most well-meaning parents and teachers. Damour also offers refreshing and
research-based practical fixes; it’s possible to normalize pressure, in many cases, and use it in
fortifying ways to build strength and confidence. Under Pressure is an invaluable read for anyone
who has girls, works with girls, or cares about girls—for everyone!”—Claire Shipman, New York Times
bestselling author of The Confidence Code and The Confidence Code for Girls

“Anyone who has read the beloved Untangled knows that Lisa Damour gets girls. This timely sequel
brings stunning clarity to the complicated set of stressors that girls experience—in the classroom,
online, with peers, and at home—and models how to show up as an ally instead of an adversary. Truly a
must-read for parents, teachers, coaches, and mentors wanting to help girls along the path to
adulthood.”—Julie Lythcott-Haims, New York Times bestselling author of How to Raise an Adult

“Under Pressure is exactly what parents need and, as a mother, it helped me to relax! Damour
explains the difference between healthy and unhealthy stress and anxiety. She offers a detailed,
comprehensive look at how to help our daughters manage naturally occurring tension, toxic stress,
and anxiety. This brilliant book is a must-read.”—Norah O’Donnell, host, CBS This Morning

“Lisa Damour is my go-to resource for all things raising girls (and I often apply her wisdom to my
  boys as well). Under Pressure is Damour at her best, addressing issues that are challenging our
  girls, from sexuality and academics to the ways girls speak and present themselves. Don’t be
  misled by the title; even if you believe your daughter isn’t unduly anxious, this is a book that
  will help you to help her navigate. Under Pressure is my gift of choice for parents of teenage
  girls, and a gift to parents everywhere.”—KJ Dell’Antonia, former editor, The New York Times’
  “Motherlode,” and author of How to Be a Happier Parent

“Under Pressure provides striking insight into the inner workings of the anxious mind. Filled
with tips for any parent, educator, or person interested in helping our girls live and
perform up to their potential, this book is a go-to guide for understanding and dealing
with stress and anxiety in girls.”—Sian Beilock, president of Barnard College at
Columbia University and author of Choke and How the Body Knows its Mind

“In readily accessible and easily assimilated prose, Damour . . . [makes] common-sense
suggestions to help parents help their daughters in these highly competitive times.
Although few of these issues are new, Damour’s instructive book pulls them into the
limelight yet again, where they can be addressed by a new generation of parents and girls.
Practical solutions backed by solid research that will help many girls overcome their high
levels of stress and anxiety.”—Kirkus Reviews

“Damour offers practical suggestions for heading off stressful encounters and counteracting
their influences. Although aimed at parents, Damour’s sensible and empathetic approach will
also be reassuring for teens seeking guidance.”—Booklist

“Lisa Damour gets girls. In a much anticipated follow up to Untangled, a work that has become a
bible for thoughtful parents of daughters everywhere, Under Pressure shines a light on a question
those of us who educate girls have been asking with increasing urgency: Why do stress and anxiety
seem to be impacting girls disproportionately at such alarming rates? Damour makes important
distinctions between healthy and toxic stress and, through both story-telling and eye-opening
research, helps parents understand that as adults we have the power to make things much better—or
worse—for our girls. When it comes to understanding the interior world of our daughters, Damour
is the girl guru.”—Elizabeth English, Head of School, The Archer School for Girls
