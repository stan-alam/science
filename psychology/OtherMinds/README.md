Although mammals and birds are widely regarded as the smartest creatures on
earth, it has lately become clear that a very distant branch of the tree
of life has also sprouted higher intelligence: the cephalopods, consisting
of the squid, the cuttlefish, and above all the octopus. In captivity,
octopuses have been known to identify individual human keepers, raid
neighboring tanks for food, turn off lightbulbs by spouting jets of water,
plug drains, and make daring escapes. How is it that a creature with such gifts
evolved through an evolutionary lineage so radically distant from our own?
What does it mean that evolution built minds not once but at least twice?
The octopus is the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien.
What can we learn from the encounter?

In Other Minds, Peter Godfrey-Smith, a distinguished philosopher of science
and a skilled scuba diver, tells a bold new story of how subjective experience
crept into being―how nature became aware of itself. As Godfrey-Smith stresses,
it is a story that largely occurs in the ocean, where animals first appeared.
Tracking the mind’s fitful development, Godfrey-Smith shows how unruly clumps
of seaborne cells began living together and became capable of sensing, acting,
and signaling. As these primitive organisms became more entangled with others,
they grew more complicated. The first nervous systems evolved, probably in
ancient relatives of jellyfish; later on, the cephalopods, which began as
inconspicuous mollusks, abandoned their shells and rose above the ocean floor,
searching for prey and acquiring the greater intelligence needed to do so.
Taking an independent route, mammals and birds later began their own
evolutionary journeys.

But what kind of intelligence do cephalopods possess? Drawing on the latest
scientific research and his own scuba-diving adventures, Godfrey-Smith probes
the many mysteries that surround the lineage. How did the octopus, a solitary
creature with little social life, become so smart? What is it like to have
eight tentacles that are so packed with neurons that they virtually “think for
themselves”? What happens when some octopuses abandon their hermit-like ways
and congregate, as they do in a unique location off the coast of Australia?

By tracing the question of inner life back to its roots and comparing human
beings with our most remarkable animal relatives, Godfrey-Smith casts crucial
new light on the octopus mind―and on our own.
