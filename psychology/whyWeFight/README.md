'Dr Mike Martin is a former British Army officer trained to fluency in Pushtu who pioneered,
designed and implemented the British Military’s Cultural Advisor-program. This program took
Pushtu-speaking British officers and trained them to build relationships with local national
notables and then leverage those relationships to understand and influence the society in which the
UK military was operating. During this period, he also worked as an advisor to four commanders of the
UK’s Task Force Helmand, advising them on local national population dynamics.

Mike subsequently read for his PhD at King’s College London in Conflict Studies (his undergraduate
degree was Biological Sciences at Oxford). He wrote an oral history of the conflict in Helmand
province, Afghanistan from 1978-2012, which he later turned into a critically-acclaimed book, An
Intimate War (published by Hurst/OUP). An Intimate War tells the story of thirty-five years of
conflict in Helmand Province, Afghanistan as seen through the eyes of the Helmandis
and describes how the UK and the US completely failed to understand the socio-political environment in Afghanistan.

Since leaving the army in 2012, Mike worked in Somaliland and Burma/Myanmar for a
risk management company as Research Director. There, he set up a new division for
the company that focused on helping multinational clients understand and navigate
the social, political and cultural environments in emerging markets and develop and
hence develop the requisite strategy.

In-between times, he conducted the first crossing of the Congo River basin by LandRover
since the 1960s.

Mike is a Visiting Research Fellow at King’s College London, where also he consults
and speaks on conflict, and comments in the international media, mostly about the causes of conflict.'

own group, and our position within it, we also interpret the causes of conflict
