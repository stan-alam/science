## notes on Shallow Seas
**Pater Hayward**
```text
Shallow Seas are the most biologically rich and productive areas of the world
ocean. This latest New Naturalist volume provides a natural history of this
environment and its biological communities. The margins of the continents,
especially broad in the North Atlantic region, are drowned by shallow seas,
creating a sea floor environment which is part of the wider and deepening
benthic realm â€“ the ecological region at the lowest level of a body of water
such as an ocean or a lake, including the sediment surface and some sub-surface
layers. These 'shelf seas' are the most biologically rich and productive areas
of the world ocean. In his latest New Naturalist volume, Peter Hayward addresses
some aspects of the natural history of the benthic environment of the shelf
seas of northwest Europe and its biological communities. Away from rocky
coastlines the seafloor is rather flat, often muddy, beneath turbid water
with low or no visibility. Benthic faunas mostly live within the sediment of...
