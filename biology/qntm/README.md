## notes on Quantum Biology

```text
Life is the most extraordinary phenomenon in the known universe; but how did it come to be?
Even in an age of cloning and artificial biology, the remarkable truth remains: nobody has ever
made anything living entirely out of dead material. Life remains the only way to make life.
Are we still missing a vital ingredient in its creation?

Like Richard Dawkins’ The Selfish Gene, which provided a new perspective on how evolution works,
Life on the Edge alters our understanding of our world’s fundamental dynamics. Bringing together
first-hand experience at the cutting edge of science with unparalleled gifts of explanation,
Jim Al-Khalili and Johnjoe Macfadden reveal that missing ingredient to be quantum mechanics; the
phenomena that lie at the heart of this most mysterious of sciences.

Drawing on recent ground-breaking experiments around the world, each chapter in Life on the Edge
engages by illustrating one of life’s puzzles: How do migrating birds know where to go? How do we
really smell the scent of a rose? How do our genes copy themselves with such precision? Life on the
Edge accessibly reveals how quantum mechanics can answer these probing questions of the universe.

Guiding the reader through the rapidly unfolding discoveries of the last few years, Al-Khalili and
McFadden communicate the excitement of the explosive new field of quantum biology and its potentially
revolutionary applications, while offering insights into the biggest puzzle of all: what is life?
As they brilliantly demonstrate in these groundbreaking pages, life exists on the quantum edge.
