## notes on 'The vital Question,  Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life.
**Nick Lane**

To explain the mystery of how life evolved on Earth, Nick Lane explores the deep link between energy and genes.
The Earth teems with life: in its oceans, forests, skies and cities. Yet there’s a black hole at the heart
of biology. We do not know why complex life is the way it is, or, for that matter, how life first began. In
The Vital Question, award-winning author and biochemist Nick Lane radically reframes evolutionary history,
putting forward a solution to conundrums that have puzzled generations of scientists.
For two and a half billion years, from the very origins of life, single-celled organisms such as bacteria
evolved without changing their basic form. Then, on just one occasion in four billion years, they made the
jump to complexity. All complex life, from mushrooms to man, shares puzzling features, such as sex, which are
unknown in bacteria. How and why did this radical transformation happen?
The answer, Lane argues, lies in energy: all life on Earth lives off a voltage with the strength of a
lightning bolt. Building on the pillars of evolutionary theory, Lane’s hypothesis draws on cutting-edge research
into the link between energy and cell biology, in order to deliver a compelling account of evolution from the
very origins of life to the emergence of multicellular organisms, while offering deep insights into our own lives
and deaths.
Both rigorous and enchanting, The Vital Question provides a solution to life’s vital question: why are we as we are,
and indeed, why are we here at all?
“What is life? How and where did it begin, even before the advent of eukaryotes? Lane tackles those and other
burning issues (sex and death) in a book as brimming with fascination as could be.” (Ray Olson – Publishers Weekly)
“One of the deepest, most illuminating books about the history of life to have been
published in recent years.” (The Economist)
