## notes on 'Deep History of Ourselves'

```text
A leading neuroscientist offers a history of the evolution of the brain from unicellular organisms to the complexity of animals and human beings today

Renowned neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux digs into the natural history of life on earth to provide a new perspective on the similarities between us and our ancestors in deep time. This page-turning survey of the whole of terrestrial evolution sheds new light on how nervous systems evolved in animals, how the brain developed, and what it means to be human.

In The Deep History of Ourselves, LeDoux argues that the key to understanding human behavior lies in viewing evolution through the prism of the first living organisms. By tracking the chain of the evolutionary timeline he shows how even the earliest single-cell organisms had to solve the same problems we and our cells have to solve each day. Along the way, LeDoux explores our place in nature, how the evolution of nervous systems enhanced the ability of organisms to survive and thrive, and how the emergence of what we humans understand as consciousness made our greatest and most horrendous achievements as a species possible.

"Deep History will take you on an ascent of the tree of life in such a way as to connect the survival capacities of ancient microbes to our own unique capacities to survive and thrive by thinking and feeling, to contemplate our personal past and future,"

"a classicist turned capital-markets attorney, contributed key millennial insights from time to time over dinner. For example, when I mentioned something about human behavior often being nonconsciously controlled, he quipped, “It’s sort of like being behind the wheel of a Tesla.” He gets a footnote or two in the book."

"Seth found parallels in plasticity-related genes between rodents and sea slugs, suggesting that they may each have inherited the ability to learn from a common ancestor that lived many hundreds of millions of years ago. But even more interesting, some of the same genes exist in single-cell protozoa. That’s relevant, since animals and current-day protozoa share a common protozoan ancestor that lived over a billion years ago."
