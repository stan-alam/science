On the basis of his research, he was able to determine the age of the crystals. They formed 26 million years ago, when volcanoes began to form the mountains. Subterranean chambers took shape inside the mountains and filled with hot mineral-laced water. The heat of the volcanic magma kept the water heated to a scalding 136 degrees F, the ideal temperature for the minerals to settle out of the water and form crystals. Somehow the water stayed at that perfect temperature for hundreds of thousands of years, allowing the crystals to grow to surreal sizes.                                                                                                    |

It was the first time anyone used the word the way we do today. But in a sense, Beijerinck simply used it to define viruses by what they were not. They were not animals, plants, fungi, or bacteria. What exactly they were, Beijerinck could not say.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

In 1923, the British virologist Frederick Twort declared, “It is impossible to define their nature.” That confusion began to disperse with the work of a chemist named Wendell Stanley. As a chemistry student in the 1920s, Stanley learned how to combine molecules into repeating patterns, forming crystals. Crystals could reveal things about substances that they otherwise kept secret. Scientists could shoot X-rays at the crystals, for example, and observe the directions that the reflected rays bounced away. The patterns produced by the X-rays offered clues to the molecules inside the crystals.                                                                                                             |

Stanley could store them away for months like table salt in a pantry. When he then added the crystals to water, they turned back into invisible viruses that could infect tobacco plants as viciously as before.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

But Stanley had also made a small but profound mistake. The British scientists Norman Pirie and Fred Bawden discovered in 1936 that viruses were not pure protein, but only 95 percent. The other 5 percent consisted of another molecule, a mysterious strand-shaped substance called nucleic acid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

To contemplate the size of viruses, tap out a single grain of salt onto a table. Stare at the tiny cube. You could line up about ten skin cells along one side of it.

And when two different flu viruses reproduce inside the same cell, things can get messy. The genes of a flu virus are stored on eight separate segments, and when a host cell starts manufacturing the segments from two different viruses at once, they sometimes get mixed together. The new offspring end up carrying genetic material from both viruses. This mixing, known as reassortment, is a viral version of sex.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The more host cells there are, the more viruses there are. Speeding up a cell’s division is no small feat, especially for a virus with just eight genes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Jules Bordet, a French immunologist who won the Nobel Prize in 1919, became Herelle’s most outspoken critic after he failed to find phages of his own. Instead of Shigella, Bordet used a harmless strain of Escherichia coli. He poured E. coli–laden liquid through fine filters, and then mixed the filtered liquid with a second batch of E. coli. The second batch died, just as they had in Herelle’s experiments. But then Bordet decided to see what would happen if he mixed the filtered liquid with the first batch of E. coli—that is, the one he had filtered in the first place. To his surprise, the first batch of E. coli was immune.                               |

Their new phage is especially effective because it’s tailored to attack the rubbery sheets that bacteria embed themselves in, known as biofilms. Biofilm can foil antibiotics and phages alike, because they can’t penetrate the tough goo and reach the bacteria inside. Collins and Lu searched through the scientific literature for a gene that might make phages better able to destroy biofilms. Bacteria themselves carry enzymes that they use to loosen up biofilms when it’s time for them to break free and float away to colonize new habitats.                                                                                      |

Sometimes doctors have to rely on expensive, last-resort drugs that come with harsh side effects. And there’s every reason to expect that bacteria will evolve to resist last-resort antibiotics as well. Scientists are scrambling to develop new antibiotics, but it can take over a decade to get a new drug from the lab to the marketplace. It may be hard to imagine a world before antibiotics, but now we must imagine a world where antibiotics are not the only weapon we use against bacteria. And now, a century after Herelle first encountered bacteriophages, these viruses may finally be ready to become a part of modern medicine.a|
