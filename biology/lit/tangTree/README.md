## Notes on the Tangled Tree

```text
In The Tangled Tree David Quammen, “one of that rare breed of science journalists
who blends exploration with a talent for synthesis and storytelling” (Nature),
chronicles these discoveries through the lives of the researchers who made
them—such as Carl Woese, the most important little-known biologist of the twentieth
century; Lynn Margulis, the notorious maverick whose wild ideas about “mosaic”
creatures proved to be true; and Tsutomu Wantanabe, who discovered that the
scourge of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a direct result of horizontal
gene transfer, bringing the deep study of genome histories to bear on a g
lobal crisis in public health.

“Quammen is no ordinary writer. He is simply astonishing, one of that rare
class of writer gifted with verve, ingenuity, humor, guts, and great heart”
(Elle). Now, in The Tangled Tree, he explains how molecular studies of
evolution have brought startling recognitions about the tangled tree of
life—including where we humans fit upon it. Thanks to new technologies
such as CRISPR, we now have the ability to alter even our genetic
composition—through sideways insertions, as nature has long been doing.
The Tangled Tree is a brilliant guide to our transformed understanding of
evolution, of life’s history, and of our own human nature.
