## notes on 'LifeSpan'

It’s a seemingly undeniable truth that aging is inevitable. But what if everything we’ve been taught to believe about aging is wrong? What if we could choose our lifespan?

In this groundbreaking book, Dr. David Sinclair, leading world authority on genetics and longevity, reveals a bold new theory for why we age. As he writes: “Aging is a disease, and that disease is treatable.”

This eye-opening and provocative work takes us to the frontlines of research that is pushing the boundaries on our perceived scientific limitations, revealing incredible breakthroughs—many from Dr. David Sinclair’s own lab at Harvard—that demonstrate how we can slow down, or even reverse, aging. The key is activating newly discovered vitality genes, the descendants of an ancient genetic survival circuit that is both the cause of aging and the key to reversing it. Recent experiments in genetic reprogramming suggest that in the near future we may not just be able to feel younger, but actually become younger.

"That was how these old mice suddenly became such mighty marathoners. Because the sirtuins had been activated, the mice’s epigenomes were becoming more stable. The valley walls were growing higher. Gravity was growing stronger. And Waddington’s marbles were being pushed back to where they belonged. The lining of the capillaries was responding as if the mice were exercised. It was an exercise mimetic, the first of its kind, and a sure sign that some aspects of age reversal are possible."

"A thousand meters is a good, long run for a mouse. Two thousand meters—five times around a standard running track—would be a substantial run for a young mouse. But there’s a reason why the program was set to three kilometers. Mice simply don’t run that far. Yet these elderly mice were running ultramarathons. Why? One of our key findings, in a study we published in 2018,42 was that when treated with an NAD-boosting molecule that activated the SIRT1 enzyme, the elderly mice’s endothelial cells, which line the blood vessels, were pushing their way into areas of the muscle that weren’t getting very much blood flow."

"“But I tell people to think of exercise as part of personal hygiene, like brushing their teeth. It should be something we do as a matter of course to keep ourselves healthy.”41 I’m sure he’s right. Most people would exercise a lot more if going to the gym were as easy as brushing their teeth. Perhaps one day it will be. Experiments in my lab indicate it is possible. “David, we’ve got a problem,” a postdoctoral researcher named Michael Bonkowski told me one morning in the fall of 2017 when I arrived at the lab."

"That’s aging. This loss of information is what leads each of us into a world of heart disease, cancer, pain, frailty, and death. If the loss of analog information is the singular reason why we age, is there anything we can do about it? Can we stabilize the marbles, keeping the valley walls high and the gravity strong? Yes. I can say with confidence that there is."

"the survival circuit. The repeated shuffling of sirtuins and other epigenetic factors away from genes to sites of broken DNA, then back again, while helpful in the short term, is ultimately what causes us to age. Over time, the wrong genes come on at the wrong time and in the wrong place."

"If the epigenome had evolved to be digital rather than analog, the valley walls would be the equivalent of 100 miles high and vertical, and gravity would be superstrong, so the marbles could never jump over into a new valley. Cells would never lose their identity. If we were built this way, we could be healthy for thousands of years, perhaps longer."

"the cell’s “fate.” We used to think this was a one-way street, an irreversible path. But in biology there is no such thing as fate. In the last decade, we’ve learned that the marbles in the Waddington landscape aren’t fixed; they have a terrible tendency to move around over time."

"On the Waddington map, an embryonic stem cell is represented by a marble at the top of a mountain peak. During embryonic development, the marble rolls down the hill and comes to rest in one of hundreds of different valleys, each representing a different possible cell type in the body. This is called “differentiation.” The epigenome guides the marbles, but it also acts as gravity after the cells come to rest, ensuring that they don’t move back up the slope or hop over into another valley."

"Waddington’s ponderings came in the dawning years of the digital revolution, at the same time that Grace Hopper, the mother of computer programming, was laying the foundation for the first widely used computer language, COBOL. In essence, what Waddington was seeking to ascertain was how cells, all running on the same code, could possibly produce different programs."

 "40 For example, having a C instead of a T variant at position rs2764264 is associated with longer life. Two of our children, Alex and Natalie, inherited two Cs at this position, one from Sandra and one from me, so all other genes being equal, and as long as they don’t live terribly negative lifestyles, they should have greater odds of reaching age 95 than I do, with my one C and one T, and substantially greater than someone with two Ts. It’s worth pausing to consider how remarkable it is that we find essentially the same longevity genes in every organism on the planet: trees, yeast, worms, whales, and humans. All living creatures come from the same place in primordium that we do. When we look through a microscope, we’re all made of the same stuff. We all share the survival circuit, a protective cellular network that helps us when times are tough. This same network is our downfall. Severe types of damage, such as broken strands of DNA, cannot be avoided. They overwork the survival circuit and change cellular identity. We’re all subject to epigenetic noise that should, under the Information Theory of Aging, cause aging. Yet different organisms age at very different rates. And sometimes, it appears, they do not age at all. What allows a whale to keep the survival circuit on without disrupting the epigenetic symphony? If the piano player’s skills are lost, how is it possible for a jellyfish to restore her ability? These are the questions that have been guiding my thoughts as I have considered where our research is headed."

 "Back in 2007, aboriginal hunters in Alaska caught a bowhead whale that, when butchered, was found to have the head of an old harpoon embedded in its blubber. The weapon, historians would later determine, had been manufactured in the late 1800s, and they estimated the whale’s age at about 130. That discovery sparked a new scientific interest in Balaena mysticetus, and later research, employing an age-determining method that measures the levels of aspartic acid in the lens of a whale’s eye, estimated that one bowhead was 211 years old when it was killed by native whalers."

 "Somniosus microcephalus is still an impressive animal and far more closely related to us. About the size of a great white, it does not even reach sexual maturity until it is 150 years old. Researchers believe the Arctic Ocean could be home to Greenland sharks that were born before Columbus got lost in the New World. Radiocarbon dating estimated that one very large individual may have lived more than 510 years, at least up until it was caught by scientists so they could measure its age. Whether this shark’s cells undergo aging is an open scientific question; very few biologists had so much as looked at S. microcephalus until the past few years. At the very least, this longest-living vertebrate undergoes the process of aging very, very slowly."

 "Bristlecones are outliers in the biological world, but they are not unique in their defiance of aging. The freshwater polyp known as Hydra vulgaris has also evolved to defy senescence. Under the right conditions, these tiny cnidarians have demonstrated a remarkable refusal to age. In the wild they might live for only a few months, subject to the powers of predation, disease, and desiccation. But in labs around the world they have been kept alive for upward of 40 years—with no signs that they’ll stop there—and indicators of health don’t differ significantly between the very young and the very old. A couple of species of jellyfish can completely regenerate from adult body parts, earning them the nickname “immortal jellies.”"

"Yet even over the course of many thousands of years, their cells do not appear to have undergone any decline in function. Scientists call this “negligible senescence.” Indeed, when a team from the Institute of Forest Genetics went looking for signs of cellular aging—studying bristlecones from 23 to 4,713 years old—they came up empty-handed. Between young and old trees, their 2001 study found, there were no meaningful differences in the chemical transportation systems, in the rate of shoot growth, in the quality of the pollen they produced, in the size of their seeds, or in the way those seeds germinated.33 The researchers also looked for deleterious mutations—the sorts of which many scientists at the time expected to be a primary cause of aging."

"Steve’s name stuck, and today he’s the namesake of the Horvath Clock—an accurate way of estimating someone’s biological age by measuring thousands of epigenetic marks on the DNA, called methylation. We tend to think of aging as something that begins happening to us at midlife, because that’s when we start to see significant changes to our bodies. But Horvath’s clock begins ticking the moment we are born. Mice have an epigenetic clock, too. Were the ICE mice older than their siblings? Yes, they were—about 50 percent older."

"A tamoxifen-triggered ICE mouse at the same age has thinning, graying hair, a bent spine, paper-thin ears, and cloudy eyes. Remember, we’d done nothing to change the genome. We’d simply broken the mice’s DNA in places where there aren’t any genes and forced the cell to paste, or “ligate,” them back together. Just to make sure, later we broke the DNA in other places, too, with the same results. Those breaks had induced a sirtuin response."

"That’s in a slime mold, its native habitat. But when I-PpoI finds itself in a mouse cell, it doesn’t have all the slime mold machinery to copy itself. So it floats around and cuts DNA at just a few places in the mouse genome, and there is no copying process. Instead, the cell has no problem pasting the DNA strands back together, leaving no mutations, which is exactly what we were looking for to engage the survival circuit and distract the sirtuins. DNA-editing genes such as Cas9 and I-PpoI are nature’s gifts to science."

"Living for 28 divisions was no advantage over those that lived for 24 and, because Sir2 uses up energy, having more of the protein may have even been a disadvantage. In the lab, however, we don’t notice any disadvantage because the yeast are given more sugar than they could possibly ever eat."

"How does the SIR2 gene actually turn off genes? SIR2 codes for a specialized protein called a histone deacetylase, or HDAC, that enzymatically cleaves the acetyl chemical tags from histones, which, as you’ll recall, causes the DNA to bundle up, preventing it from being transcribed into RNA."

"When sirtuins shift from their typical priorities to engage in DNA repair, their epigenetic function at home ends for a bit. Then, when the damage is fixed and they head back to home base, they get back to doing what they usually do: controlling genes and making sure the cell retains its identity and optimal function."

"I’ve come to think of sirtuins as the directors of a multifaceted disaster response corps, sending out a variety of specialized emergency teams to address DNA stability, DNA repair, cell survivability, metabolism, and cell-to-cell communication. In a way, this is like the command center for the thousands of utility workers who descended upon Louisiana and Mississippi in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Most of the workers weren’t from the Gulf Coast, but they came, did their level best to fix what was broken, and then went home. Some were working in the storm-ravaged communities for a few days and others for a few weeks before returning to their normal lives. And for most, it wasn’t the first or last time they had done something like that; anytime there’s a mass disaster"

**"In yeast, we had shown that DNA breaks cause sirtuins to relocalize away from silent mating-type genes, causing old cells to become sterile. That was a simple system, and we’d figured it out in a few years. But is the survival circuit causing aging in mammals? What parts of the system survived the billion years, and which are yeast specific?

"If you are skeptical, and you should be, you might assume these SIRT mutant mice could just be sick and, therefore, short lived.

"Among the reasons, the team reported in the journal Cancer Cell, was an impaired ability to respond to and repair DNA damage.27 In 2006, Frederick Alt, Katrin Chua, and Raul Mostovslavsky at Harvard showed that mice engineered to lack SIRT6 underwent the typical signs of aging faster along with shortened lifespans.28 When the scientists knocked out a cell’s ability to create this vital protein, the cell lost its ability to repair double-strand DNA breaks, just as we had showed in yeast back in 1999."

"22 But the true extent to which the survival circuit is conserved between yeast and humans wasn’t fully known until 2017, when Eva Bober’s team at the Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research in Bad Nauheim, Germany, reported that sirtuins stabilize human rDNA.23 Then, in 2018, Katrin Chua at Stanford University found that, by stabilizing human rDNA, sirtuins prevent cellular senescence—essentially the same antiaging function as we had found for sirtuins in yeast twenty years earlier.24 That was an astonishing revelation: over a billion years of separation between yeast and us, and, in essence, the circuit hadn’t changed. By the time those findings appeared, though, it was clear to me that epigenomic noise was a likely catalyst of human aging. Two decades of research had already been leading us in that direction.25"

"It was epigenomic noise in its purest form. It took another twenty years to learn if those findings in yeast were relevant to organisms more complex than yeast. We mammals have seven sirtuin genes that have evolved a variety of functions beyond what simple SIR2 can do. Three of them, SIRT1, SIRT6, and SIRT7, are critical to the control of the epigenome and DNA repair. The others, SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5, reside in mitochondria, where they control energy metabolism, while SIRT2 buzzes around the cytoplasm, where it controls cell division and healthy egg production. There had been many clues along the way. Brown University’s Stephen Helfand showed that adding extra copies of the dSir2 gene to fruit flies suppresses epigenetic noise and extends their lifespan."

"That was the first step of the survival circuit, though at the time we had no idea that it was as ancient and as essential to our very existence as it turned out to be. We told the world that we could give yeast a Werner-like syndrome, causing exploded nucleoli.18 We described the ways in which mutants of SGS1, those we’d plagued with the yeast equivalent to the Werner syndrome mutation, accumulated ERCs more rapidly, leading to premature aging and a shortened lifespan.19 Crucially, by demonstrating that if you add an ERC to young cells they age prematurely, we had crucial evidence that ERCs don’t just happen during aging, they cause it. And by artificially breaking the DNA in the cell and watching the cellular response, we showed why sirtuins move—to help with DNA repair."

"Just like the mutants, the normal old yeast cells were packed with ERCs. That was a “Eureka!” moment. Not proof—a good scientist never has proof of anything—but the first substantial confirmation of a theory, the foundation upon which I and others would build more discoveries in the years to come. The first testable prediction was if we put an ERC into very young yeast cells—and we devised a genetic trick to do that—the ERCs would multiply and distract the sirtuins, and the yeast cells would age prematurely, go sterile, and die young—and they did. We published that work in December 1997 in the scientific journal Cell, and the news broke around the world: “Scientists figured out a cause of aging.” It was there and then that Matt Kaeberlein, a PhD student at the time, arrived at the lab. His first experiment was to insert an extra copy of SIR2 into the genome of yeast cells to see if it could stabilize the yeast genome and delay aging. When the extra SIR2 was added, ERCs were prevented, and he saw a 30 percent increase in the yeast cells’ lifespan, as we’d been hoping. Our hypothesis seemed to be standing up to scrutiny: the fundamental, upstream cause of sterility and aging in yeast was the inherent instability of the genome."

"We don’t count the age of a single yeast cell with birthday candles. They simply don’t last that long. Instead, aging in yeast is measured by the number of times a mother cell divides to produce daughter cells. In most cases, a yeast cell gets to about 25 divisions before it dies. That, however, makes obtaining old yeast cells an exceptionally challenging task. Because by the time an average yeast cell expires, it is surrounded by 225, or 33 million, of its descendants."

"The highly repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is unstable, and toxic DNA circles form; these recombine and eventually accumulate to toxic levels in old cells, killing them. In response to DNA circles and the perceived genome instability, Sir2 moves away from silent mating-type genes to help stabilize the genome. Both male and female genes turn on, causing infertility, the main hallmark of yeast aging."

Epigenetic noise causes the same kind of chaos. It is driven in large part by highly disruptive insults to the cell, such as broken DNA, as it was in the original survival circuit of M. superstes and in the old yeast cells that lost their fertility. And this, according to the Information Theory of Aging, is why we age. It’s why our hair grays. It’s why our skin wrinkles. It’s why our joints begin to ache. Moreover, it’s why each one of the hallmarks of aging occurs, from stem cell exhaustion and cellular senescence to mitochondrial dysfunction and rapid telomere shortening. This is, I acknowledge, a bold theory. And the strength of a theory is based on how well it predicts the results of rigorous experiments, often millions of them, the number of phenomena it can explain, and its simplicity. The theory was simple, and it explained a lot. As good scientists, what we had left to do was to try our best to disprove it and see how long it survived."

"take a few thousand.14 Each key can also be played pianissimo (soft) or forte (with force). The notes can be tenuto (held) or allegretto (played quickly). For master pianists, there are hundreds of ways to play each individual key and endless ways to play the keys together, in chords and combinations that create music we know as jazz, ragtime, rock, reggae, waltzes, whatever. The pianist that makes this happen is the epigenome. Through a process of revealing our DNA or bundling it up in tight protein packages, and by marking genes with chemical tags called methyls and acetyls composed of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, the epigenome uses our genome to make the music of our lives. Yes, sometimes the size, shape, and condition of a piano dictate what a pianist can do with it. It’s tough to play a concerto on an eighteen-key toy piano, and it’s mighty hard to make beautiful music on an instrument that hasn’t been tuned in fifty years. Likewise, the genome certainly dictates what the epigenome can do. A caterpillar can’t become a human being, but it can become a butterfly by virtue of changes in epigenetic expression that occur during metamorphosis, even though its genome never changes. Similarly, the child of two parents from a long line of people with black hair and brown eyes isn’t likely to develop blond hair and blue eyes, but twin agouti mice in the lab can turn out brown or golden, depending on how much the Agouti gene is turned on during gestation by environmental influences on the epigenome, such as folic acid, vitamin B12, genistein from soy, or the toxin bisphenol A.15 Similarly, among monozygotic human twins, epigenetic forces can drive two people with the same genome in vastly different directions. It can even cause them to age differently. You can see this clearly in side-by-side photographs of the faces of smoking and nonsmoking twins; their DNA is still largely the same, but the smokers have bigger bags under their eyes, deeper jowls below their chins, and more wrinkles around their eyes and mouths. They are not older, but they’ve clearly aged faster. Studies of identical twins place the genetic influences on longevity at between 10 and 25 percent which, by any estimation, is surprisingly low.16 Our DNA is not our destiny. Now imagine you’re in a concert hall. A virtuoso pianist is seated at a gorgeously polished Steinway grand. The concerto begins. The music is beautiful, breathtaking. Everything is perfect. But then, a few minutes into the piece, the pianist misses a key. The first time it happens, it’s almost unnoticeable—an extra D, perhaps, in a chord that doesn’t need that note. Embedded in so many perfectly played notes, hidden among an otherwise flawless chord in an otherwise perfect melody, it’s nothing to worry about. But then, a few minutes later, it happens again. And then, with increasing frequency, again and again and again. It’s important to remember that there is nothing wrong with the piano. And the pianist is playing most of the notes prescribed by the composer. She’s just also playing some extra notes. Initially, this is just annoying. Over time it becomes unsettling. Eventually it ruins the concerto. Indeed, we’d assume that there was something wrong with the pianist. Someone might even rush onto the stage to make sure she"

"Sirtuins instruct the histone spooling proteins to bind up DNA tightly, while they leave other regions to flail around. In this way, some genes stay silent, while others can be accessed by DNA-binding transcription factors that turn genes on.12 Accessible genes are said to be in “euchromatin,” while silent genes are in “heterochromatin.” By removing chemical tags on histones, sirtuins help prevent transcription factors from binding to genes, converting euchromatin into heterochromatin. Every one of our cells has the same DNA, of course, so what differentiates a nerve cell from a skin cell is the epigenome, the collective term for the control systems and cellular structures that tell the cell which genes should be turned on and which should remain off. And this, far more than our genes, is what actually controls much of our lives. One of the best ways to visualize this is to think of our genome as a grand piano.13 Each gene is a key. Each key produces a note.

Not a countless number of separate cellular changes or diseases. Not even a set of hallmarks that could be addressed one at a time. There was something bigger—and more singular—than any of that.

"And what was happening was fascinating. The nucleolus is a part of the nucleus in which ribosomal DNA, or rDNA, resides. rDNA is copied into ribosomal RNA, which is used by ribosome enzymes to stitch amino acids together to make every new protein. In the aged SGS1 cells, the nucleolus looked as if it had exploded. Instead of a single red crescent swimming in a blue ocean, the nucleolus was scattered into half a dozen small islands. It was tragic and beautiful. The picture, which would later appear in the August 1997 issue of the prestigious journal Science, still hangs in my office. What happened next was both enchanting and illuminating. In response to the damage, like rats to the call of the Pied Piper, the protein called Sir2—the first known sirtuin, which is encoded by the gene SIR210 and descended from gene B—had moved away from the mating genes that control fertility and into the nucleolus. That was a beautiful sight to me, but it was a problem for the yeast. Sir2 has an important job: it is an epigenetic factor, an enzyme that sits on genes, bundles up the DNA, and keeps them silent. At the molecular level, Sir2 achieves this via its enzymatic activity, making sure that chemicals called acetyls don’t accumulate on the histones and loosen the DNA packaging. When sirtuins left the mating genes—the ones descended from gene A that controlled fertility and reproduction—the mutant cells turned on both male and female genes, causing them to lose their sexual identity, just as in normal old cells, but much earlier."

"But those cells weren’t just dying. They were dying after a precipitous decline in health and function. As the SGS1 mutants became older, they slowed down in their cell cycle. They grew larger. Both male and female “mating-type” genes (descendants of gene A) were switched on at the same time, so they were sterile and couldn’t mate. These were all known hallmarks of aging in yeast. And it was happening more quickly in the mutants we’d made. It certainly looked like a yeast version of Werner’s."

Many events unrelated to aging—such as being eaten by a mite, drying out on a grape, or being placed in an oven—can and do shorten the lifespan of yeast cells.

And what it does with those genes isn’t so different from what we do with them. Like a whole lot of humans, yeast cells are almost always trying to do one of two things: either they’re trying to eat, or they’re trying to reproduce. They’re hungry or they’re horny. As they age, much like humans, they slow down and grow larger, rounder, and less fertile."

But unlike the oncogenes that were discovered in the 1970s and that have given us a good target for going to battle against cancer, we haven’t identified a singular gene that causes aging.

Like sirtuins, scientists have found TOR—called mTOR in mammals—in every organism in which they’ve looked for it. Like that of sirtuins, mTOR activity is exquisitely regulated by nutrients. And like the sirtuins, mTOR can signal cells in stress to hunker down and improve survival by boosting such activities as DNA repair, reducing inflammation caused by senescent cells, and, perhaps its most important function, digesting old proteins."

"sirtuins are enzymes that remove acetyl tags from histones and other proteins and, by doing so, change the packaging of the DNA, turning genes off and on when needed. These critical epigenetic regulators sit at the very top of cellular control systems, controlling our reproduction and our DNA repair. After a few billion years of advancement since the days of yeast, they have evolved to control our health, our fitness, and our very survival. They have also evolved to require a molecule called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD. As we will see later, the loss of NAD as we age, and the resulting decline in sirtuin activity, is thought to be a primary reason our bodies develop diseases when we are old but not when we are young."

"Analog data are superior for this job because they can be changed back and forth with relative ease whenever the environment within or outside the cell demands it, and they can store an almost unlimited number of possible values, even in response to conditions that have never been encountered before.25 The unlimited number of possible values is why many audiophiles still prefer the rich sounds of analog storage systems. But even though analog devices have their advantages, they have a major disadvantage. In fact, it’s the reason we’ve moved from analog to digital. Unlike digital, analog information degrades over time—falling victim to the conspiring forces of magnetic fields, gravity, cosmic rays, and oxygen. Worse still, information is lost as it’s copied.

"The other type of information in the body is analog. We don’t hear as much about analog information in the body. That’s in part because it’s newer to science, and in part because it’s rarely described in terms of information, even though that’s how it was first described when geneticists noticed strange nongenetic effects in plants they were breeding. Today, analog information is more commonly referred to as the epigenome, meaning traits that are heritable that aren’t transmitted by genetic means. The term epigenetics was first coined in 1942 by Conrad H. Waddington, a British developmental biologist, while working at Cambridge University. In the past decade, the meaning of the word epigenetics has expanded into other areas of biology that have less to do with heredity—including embryonic development, gene switch networks, and chemical modifications of DNA-packaging proteins—much to the chagrin of orthodox geneticists in my department at Harvard Medical School. In the same way that genetic information is stored as DNA, epigenetic information is stored in a structure called chromatin. DNA in the cell isn’t flailing around disorganized, it is wrapped around tiny balls of protein called histones. These beads on a string self-assemble to form loops, as when you tidy your garden hose on your driveway by looping it into a pile. If you were to play tug-of-war using both ends of a chromosome, you’d end up with a six foot-long string of DNA punctuated by thousands of histone proteins. If you could somehow plug one end of the DNA into a power socket and make the histones flash on and off, a few cells could do you for holiday lights."

"The first type of information—the type my esteemed predecessors understood—is digital. Digital information, as you likely know, is based on a finite set of possible values—in this instance, not in base 2 or binary, coded as 0s and 1s, but the sort that is quaternary or base 4, coded as adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine, the nucleotides A, T, C, G of DNA. Because DNA is digital, it is a reliable way to store and copy information. Indeed, it can be copied again and again with tremendous accuracy, no different in principle from digital information stored in computer memory or on a DVD. DNA is also robust. When I first worked in a lab, I was shocked by how this “molecule of life” could survive for hours in boiling water and thrilled that it was recoverable from Neanderthal remains at least 40,000 years old."

"These theories fit with observations and are generally accepted. Individuals don’t live forever because natural selection doesn’t select for immortality in a world where an existing body plan works perfectly well to pass along a body’s selfish genes. And because all species are resource limited, they have evolved to allocate the available energy either to reproduction or to longevity, but not to both. That was as true for M. superstes as it was and still is for all species that have ever lived on this planet. **All, that is, except one: Homo sapiens. Having capitalized on its relatively large brain and a thriving civilization to overcome the unfortunate hand that evolution dealt it—weak limbs, sensitivity to cold, poor sense of smell, and eyes that see well only in daylight and in the visible spectrum—this highly unusual species continues to innovate. It has already provided itself with an abundance of food, nutrients, and water while reducing deaths from predation, exposure, infectious diseases, and warfare. These were all once limits to its evolving a longer lifespan. With them removed, a few million years of evolution might double its lifespan, bringing it closer to the lifespans of some other species at the top of their game."**

**"Known as the “Disposable Soma Hypothesis,**” it is based on the fact that there are always limited resources available to species—energy, nutrients, water. They therefore evolve to a point that lies somewhere between two very different lifestyles: breed fast and die young, or breed slowly and maintain your soma, or body. Kirkwood reasoned that organisms can’t breed fast and maintain a robust, healthy body—there simply isn’t enough energy to do both. Stated another way, in the history of life, any line of creature with a mutation that caused it to live fast and attempt to die old soon ran out of resources and was thus deleted from the gene pool."

"From the looks of it, aging is not going to be that hard to treat, far easier than curing cancer. Up until the second half of the twentieth century, it was generally accepted that organisms grow old and die “for the good of the species”—an idea that dates back to Aristotle, if not further. This idea feels quite intuitive. It is the explanation proffered by most people at parties.4 But it is dead wrong. We do not die to make way for the next generation. In the 1950s, the concept of “group selection” in evolution was going out of style, prompting three evolutionary biologists, J. B. S. Haldane, Peter B. Medawar, and George C. Williams, to propose some important ideas about why we age. When it comes to longevity, they agreed, individuals look out for themselves. Driven by their selfish genes, they press on and try to breed for as long and as fast as they can, so long as it doesn’t kill them. (In some cases, however, they press on too much, as my great-grandfather Miklós Vitéz, a Hungarian screenwriter, proved to his bride forty-five years his junior on their wedding night.)"

By inventing chemicals that specifically block the tumor-promoting proteins, we could finally begin to move away from using radiation and toxic chemotherapeutic agents to attack cancers at their genetic source, while leaving normal cells untouched."

"The human body, though far from perfect and still evolving, carries an advanced version of the survival circuit that allows it to last for decades past the age of reproduction. While it is interesting to speculate why our long lifespans first evolved—the need for grandparents to educate the tribe is one appealing theory—given the chaos that exists at the molecular scale, it’s a wonder we survive thirty seconds, let alone make it to our reproductive years, let alone reach 80 more often than not. But we do. Marvelously we do. Miraculously we do. For we are the progeny of a very long lineage of great survivors. Ergo, we are great survivors. But there is a trade-off. For this circuit within us, the descendant of a series of mutations in our most distant ancestors, is also the reason we age. And yes, that definite singular article is correct: it is the reason."

"When the latest dry period ends and the lakes refill, M. superstes wakes up. Now it can reproduce. Again and again it does so. Multiplying. Moving into new biomes. Evolving. Creating generations upon generations of new descendants. They are our Adam and Eve. Like Adam and Eve, we don’t know if M. superstes ever existed. But my research over the past twenty-five years suggests that every living thing we see around us today is a product of this great survivor, or at least a primitive organism very much like it. The fossil record in our genes goes a long way to proving that every living thing that shares this planet with us still carries this ancient genetic survival circuit, in more or less the same basic form."

"This makes sense, because while DNA is broken, sex and reproduction are the last things an organism should be doing. In future multicellular organisms, for instance, cells that fail to pause while fixing a DNA break will almost certainly lose genetic material. This is because DNA is pulled apart prior to cell division from only one attachment site on the DNA, dragging the rest of the DNA with it. If DNA is broken, part of a chromosome will be lost or duplicated. The cells will likely die or multiply uncontrollably into a tumor."

"the horizontal transfer of genes from one species to another—will create organisms with bilateral symmetry, stereoscopic vision, and even consciousness. By comparison, this early evolutionary step looks, at first, to be rather simple. It is a circuit. A gene circuit. The circuit begins with gene A, a caretaker that stops cells from reproducing when times are tough. This is key, because on early planet Earth, most times are tough. The circuit also has a gene B, which encodes for a “silencing” protein. This silencing protein shuts gene A off when times are good, so the cell can make copies of itself when, and only when, it and its offspring will likely survive."
