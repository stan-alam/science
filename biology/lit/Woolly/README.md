## Most Iconic Extinct Creatures

Abstract

The 28,000-year-old remains of a woolly mammoth, named ‘Yuka’, were found in Siberian permafrost.
Here we recovered the less-damaged nucleus-like structures from the remains and visualised
their dynamics in living mouse oocytes after nuclear transfer. Proteomic analyses demonstrated
the presence of nuclear components in the remains. Nucleus-like structures found in the tissue homogenate were
histone- and lamin-positive by immunostaining. In the reconstructed oocytes, the mammoth nuclei showed the
spindle assembly, histone incorporation and partial nuclear formation; however, the full activation of nuclei for
cleavage was not confirmed. DNA damage levels, which varied among the nuclei, were comparable to those of
frozen-thawed mouse sperm and were reduced in some reconstructed oocytes. Our work provides a platform to evaluate
the biological activities of nuclei in extinct animal species.

```text
With his knack for turning narrative nonfiction into stories worthy of the best
thriller fiction” (Omnivoracious), Ben Mezrich takes us on an exhilarating true
adventure story from the icy terrain of Siberia to the cutting-edge genetic
labs of Harvard University. A group of young scientists, under the guidance of
Dr. George Church, the most brilliant geneticist of our time, works to make fantasy
reality by sequencing the DNA of a frozen woolly mammoth harvested from above the Arctic
circle, and splicing elements of that sequence into the DNA of a modern elephant. Will
they be able to turn the hybrid cells into a functional embryo and bring the extinct
creatures to life in our modern world?

Along with Church and his team of Harvard scientists, a world-famous conservationist
and a genius Russian scientist plan to turn a tract of the Siberian tundra into Pleistocene Park,
populating the permafrost with ancient herbivores as a hedge against an environmental ticking
time bomb. More than a story of genetics, this is a thriller illuminating the race against global
warming, the incredible power of modern technology, the brave fossil hunters who battle polar
bears and extreme weather conditions, and the ethical quandary of cloning extinct animals.
Can we right the wrongs of our ancestors who hunted the woolly mammoth to
extinction—and at what cost?
