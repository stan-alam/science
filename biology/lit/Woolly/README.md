## notes on Woolly: The True Story of the Quest to Revive One of History’s
## Most Iconic Extinct Creatures

```text
With his knack for turning narrative nonfiction into stories worthy of the best
thriller fiction” (Omnivoracious), Ben Mezrich takes us on an exhilarating true
adventure story from the icy terrain of Siberia to the cutting-edge genetic
labs of Harvard University. A group of young scientists, under the guidance of
Dr. George Church, the most brilliant geneticist of our time, works to make fantasy
reality by sequencing the DNA of a frozen woolly mammoth harvested from above the Arctic
circle, and splicing elements of that sequence into the DNA of a modern elephant. Will
they be able to turn the hybrid cells into a functional embryo and bring the extinct
creatures to life in our modern world?

Along with Church and his team of Harvard scientists, a world-famous conservationist
and a genius Russian scientist plan to turn a tract of the Siberian tundra into Pleistocene Park,
populating the permafrost with ancient herbivores as a hedge against an environmental ticking
time bomb. More than a story of genetics, this is a thriller illuminating the race against global
warming, the incredible power of modern technology, the brave fossil hunters who battle polar
bears and extreme weather conditions, and the ethical quandary of cloning extinct animals.
Can we right the wrongs of our ancestors who hunted the woolly mammoth to
extinction—and at what cost?
