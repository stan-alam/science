## notes on The Consciousness Instinct

```text
How do neurons turn into minds? How does physical “stuff”―atoms, molecules,
chemicals, and cells―create the vivid and various worlds inside our heads?
The problem of consciousness has gnawed at us for millennia. In the last
century there have been massive breakthroughs that have rewritten the science
of the brain, and yet the puzzles faced by the ancient Greeks are still present.
In The Consciousness Instinct, the neuroscience pioneer Michael S. Gazzaniga
puts the latest research in conversation with the history of human thinking
about the mind, giving a big-picture view of what science has revealed about
consciousness.

The idea of the brain as a machine, first proposed centuries ago, has led to
assumptions about the relationship between mind and brain that dog scientists
and philosophers to this day. Gazzaniga asserts that this model has it
backward―brains make machines, but they cannot be reduced to one.
New research suggests the brain is actually a confederation of
independent modules working together. Understanding how consciousness
could emanate from such an organization will help define the future of
brain science and artificial intelligence, and close the gap
between brain and mind.
