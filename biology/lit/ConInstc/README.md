## notes on The Consciousness Instinct

```text
How do neurons turn into minds? How does physical “stuff”―atoms, molecules,
chemicals, and cells―create the vivid and various worlds inside our heads?
The problem of consciousness has gnawed at us for millennia. In the last
century there have been massive breakthroughs that have rewritten the science
of the brain, and yet the puzzles faced by the ancient Greeks are still present.
In The Consciousness Instinct, the neuroscience pioneer Michael S. Gazzaniga
puts the latest research in conversation with the history of human thinking
about the mind, giving a big-picture view of what science has revealed about
consciousness.

The idea of the brain as a machine, first proposed centuries ago, has led to
assumptions about the relationship between mind and brain that dog scientists
and philosophers to this day. Gazzaniga asserts that this model has it
backward―brains make machines, but they cannot be reduced to one.
New research suggests the brain is actually a confederation of
independent modules working together. Understanding how consciousness
could emanate from such an organization will help define the future of
brain science and artificial intelligence, and close the gap
between brain and mind.

Summary: Researchers explore consciousness and argue our conscious processes may be formed by efficient
non-conscious brain systems.

As the very word used to describe it has been “worn smooth by a million tongues”, consciousness
is a fertile topic for confusion. We all know what it is to be conscious. It is, basically, being aware
of and responding to the world. Similarly, we all possess a common sense notion of how consciousness works.

But common sense can be easily confused. Consider these questions for example: if you felt pain in an
amputated leg, where is the pain? If you say it is in your head, would it be in your head if your leg
had not been amputated? If you say yes, then what reason have you for ever thinking you had a leg?

One source of confusion when explaining “consciousness” stems from common sense and formal accounts
that frame the study of mental life. These are typically discussed in terms of a binary split between
conscious intentional processes versus non-conscious involuntary processes – the latter of which are
outside our awareness. When walking, for example, we have a conscious awareness of the intention to go
somewhere. Yet putting one foot in front of the other is a non-conscious action.

Following this, most of us consider consciousness – our subjective awareness – to be responsible for
creating and controlling our thoughts, memories and actions. At the same time, we recognise that some of
these psychological processes are carried on beyond our awareness. For example, when picking up a pen we
may know what we are going to write about but the selection and articulation of individual words are
non-conscious processes.

The key driver behind this traditional distinction stems from our own powerful belief that causality
links subjective awareness with the daily experience of appearing to have control over our thoughts,
feelings and actions. Over the past 100 years, however, a growing body of evidence has begun to question
this binary distinction. There is now increasing agreement that most, if not all, of the contents of our
psychological processes – our thoughts, beliefs, sensations, perceptions, emotions, intentions,
actions and memories – are actually formed backstage by fast and efficient non-conscious brain systems.

The non-conscious nature of being

Previously, we argued that while undeniably real, the “experience of consciousness” or subjective
awareness is precisely that – awareness. No more, no less. We proposed that while consciousness is
created by brain systems, it has no causal relationship with or control over mental processes. The
fact that personal awareness accompanies the contents of the personal narrative is causally compelling.
But it is not necessarily relevant to understanding and explaining the psychological processes
underpinning them.

If we are indeed “subjects of unconscious authoring” then continuing to characterise psychological states
in terms of being conscious and non-conscious is unhelpful. NeuroscienceNews.com image is adapted from

This quote from George Miller – one of the founders of cognitive psychology – helps explain this idea.
When one recalls something from memory, “consciousness gives no clue as to where the answer comes from;
the processes that produce it are unconscious. It is the result of thinking, not the process of thinking,
that appears spontaneously in consciousness”.

Taking this further, we propose, that subjective awareness – the intimate signature experience of what it
is like to be conscious – is itself a product of non-conscious processing. This observation, was well captured
by pioneering social psychologist Daniel Wegner when he wrote that, “unconscious mechanisms create both conscious
thought about action and the action, and also produce the sense of will we experience by perceiving the thought
as the cause of the action”.

Our proposition that both the subjective experience of consciousness (personal awareness) and associated
psychological processes (thoughts, beliefs, ideas, intentions and more) are products of non-conscious processes
is consistent with the fact that non-conscious automatic brain systems reliably carry out all of our core biological
processes (such as respiration and digestion) efficiently, and often without our awareness.

It is also consistent with a wider prevailing observation found in the natural sciences – especially neurobiology.
In this field conscious primacy is not nearly as prevalent as it is in psychology. Complex and intelligent design
in living things are not assumed to be driven by conscious processes. Instead they are thought to come from adaptive
processes which accrued through natural selection.

Moving on from the divide

If we are indeed “subjects of unconscious authoring” then continuing to characterise psychological states in
terms of being conscious and non-conscious is unhelpful. It constrains the theoretical understanding of psychological
processes. Furthermore, if all psychological processes and their products rely on non-conscious systems,
then the idea that the brain has automatic and controlled processes needs a rethink too. It might be better to
describe them as differences on a continuum of non-conscious processing, rather than alternative systems.

Such a proposal does not dispense with the common sense reality of one’s personal qualitative experience, nor
with the previous findings of cognitive neuroscience. However, it offers an opportunity to reduce some of the confusion
that comes with use of the terms “consciousness” and “contents of consciousness”. Both of which continue to imply that
consciousness has a functional role in distinguishing psychological processes.
