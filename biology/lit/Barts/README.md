## notes on the Butchering Arts

```text
In The Butchering Art, the historian Lindsey Fitzharris reveals the shocking world of
nineteenth-century surgery on the eve of profound transformation. She conjures up
early operating theaters—no place for the squeamish—and surgeons, working before
anesthesia, who were lauded for their speed and brute strength. These medical
pioneers knew that the aftermath of surgery was often more dangerous than their
patients’ afflictions, and they were baffled by the persistent infections that
kept mortality rates stubbornly high. At a time when surgery couldn’t have been
more hazardous, an unlikely figure stepped forward: a young, melancholy Quaker
surgeon named Joseph Lister, who would solve the deadly riddle and change the
course of history.

Fitzharris dramatically recounts Lister’s discoveries in gripping detail, culminating
in his audacious claim that germs were the source of all infection—and could be
countered by antiseptics. Focusing on the tumultuous period from 1850 to 1875, s
he introduces us to Lister and his contemporaries—some of them brilliant, some outright
criminal—and takes us through the grimy medical schools and dreary hospitals where they
learned their art, the deadhouses where they studied anatomy, and the graveyards they
occasionally ransacked for cadavers.

Eerie and illuminating, The Butchering Art celebrates the triumph of a visionary
surgeon whose quest to unite science and medicine delivered us into the modern world.
