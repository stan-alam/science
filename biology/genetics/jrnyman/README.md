## Journey of Man

```text
Around 60,000 years ago, a man—genetically identical to us—lived in Africa. Every
person alive today is descended from him. How did this real-life Adam wind up as the
father of us all? What happened to the descendants of other men who lived at the same time?
And why, if modern humans share a single prehistoric ancestor, do we come in so many sizes,
shapes, and races?

Examining the hidden secrets of human evolution in our genetic code, Spencer Wells reveals how
developments in the revolutionary science of population genetics have made it possible to create
a family tree for the whole of humanity. Replete with marvelous anecdotes and remarkable information,
from the truth about the real Adam and Eve to the way differing racial types emerged,
The Journey of Man is an enthralling, epic tour through the history and development of early humankind.
In this surprisingly accessible book, British geneticist Wells sets out to answer
long-standing anthropological questions of where humans came from, how we migrated and when we
arrived in such places as Europe and North America. To trace the migration of human beings from
our earliest homes in Africa to the farthest reaches of the globe, Wells calls on recent DNA
research for support. Clues in the blood of present groups such as eastern Russia’s Chukchi,
as well as the biological remnants of long-extinct human clans, allow Wells to follow the Y
chromosome as a relatively unaltered marker of human heritage. Eventually, working backward
through time, he finds that the earliest common “ingredient” in males’ genetic soup was found
in a man Wells calls the “Eurasian Adam,” who lived in Africa between 31,000 and 79,000 years
ago. Each subsequent population, isolated from its fellows, gained new genetic markers,
creating a map in time and space. Wells writes that the first modern humans “left Africa only
2,000 generations ago” and quickly fanned out across Asia, into Europe, and across the
then-extant land bridge into the Americas. Using the same markers, he debunks the notion that
Neanderthals were our ancestors, finds odd links between faraway peoples, and-most
startlingly-discovers that all Native Americans can be traced to a group of perhaps a dozen
people. By explaining his terminology and methods throughout the book, instead of in a chunk,
Wells makes following the branches of the human tree seem easy
