Deer Hunting With Jesus
Dispatches from America’s Class war, by Joe Bageant

I’d like to hear from US readers who know the book. First, a quick review.
Bageant grew up in small town West Virginia, and the town is the subject of his book. It’s a brutally honest portrait of a community that he says is increasingly overlooked by the rest of the US. They’re deep in the red states. They’re the working poor, and getting poorer. They’re insular and not well educated, but are generally religious fundamentalists with a fierce work ethic. They’re steeped in gun culture and brought up to take patriotic pride in conservative values that ironically may have become their worst enemy. The book has a Hillbilly Elegy feel to it.
Bageant has a great turn of phrase and a gonzo-street vibe. He paints intimate, sad, loving portraits of the people he grew up with and still proudly lives among.

At a surface level most Westerners tend to assume we could slot into any other developed English speaking country and fit in just fine. But this blew me away. I’m Australian, and likely because of our smaller population we are much more homogeneous than the US. Bageant suggests that most big city or college educated Americans also fail to understand the heart of these communities.

BUT, it’s 15 years old. I’d like to know if it’s still true, was it ever true, or has that culture changed markedly since then? I suspect, given since the book was released and Trump happened, the answer is ‘not much’.

I’m also aware Bageant likely told the stories that suit his thesis. He’s an educated socialist in a red-neck town and I doubt his world is simply the uneducated mono-culture he describes. But I’d like to hear first hand. Thanks.

Well, I read the book and while I am at the opposite end of the political spectrum from the author, I thought he really hit the nail on the heads in many cases. As a native of that area myself, yep, he got it right. I found myself in the uncomfortable position of disagreeing with his California-liberal style perspective but agreeing with most of what he said in the book. Good to be challenged like that. Bageant writes of the people sympathetically and humorously. Still a lot of folks waddling around on disability, diabetic and COPD, smoking like chimneys while they can barely pay their rent, eating junk food til it comes out their ears... sad.

After thirty years spent scratching together a middle-class life out of a dirt-poor childhood, 
Joe Bageant moved back to his hometown of Winchester, Virginia, where he realized that 
his family and neighbors were the very people who carried George W. Bush to victory. That was 
ironic, because Winchester, like countless American small towns, is fast becoming the bedrock of 
a permanent underclass. Two in five of the people in his old neighborhood do not have high school diplomas. 
Nearly everyone over fifty has serious health problems, and many have no health care. 
Credit ratings are low or nonexistent, and alcohol, overeating, and Jesus are the preferred avenues of escape.

A raucous mix of storytelling and political commentary, Deer Hunting with Jesus is Bageant's 
report on what he learned by coming home. He writes of his childhood friends who work at factory 
jobs that are constantly on the verge of being outsourced; the mortgage and credit card rackets 
that saddle the working poor with debt, i.e., white trashonomics; the ubiquitous gun culture”and 
why the left doesn't get it; Scots Irish culture and how it played out in the young life of 
Lynddie England; and the blinkered magical thinking of the Christian right. 
(Bageant's brother is a Baptist pastor who casts out demons.) What it adds up to, he asserts, 
is an unacknowledged class war. By turns brutal, tender, incendiary, and seriously funny, 
this book is a call to arms for fellow progressives with little real understanding of the 
great beery, NASCAR-loving, church-going, gun-owning America that has never set foot in a Starbucks.

Deer Hunting with Jesus is a potent antidote to what Bageant dubs the "American hologram" 
the televised, corporatized virtual reality that distracts us from the insidious realities of American life. (less)
