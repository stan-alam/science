## notes on The Most Elegant Equation
**by David Stipp**

```text
Bertrand Russell wrote that mathematics can exalt “as surely as poetry.” This
is especially true of one equation: ei(pi) + 1 = 0, the brainchild of Leonhard
Euler, the Mozart of mathematics. More than two centuries after Euler’s death,
it is still regarded as a conceptual diamond of unsurpassed beauty. Called
Euler’s identity or God’s equation, it includes just five numbers but
represents an astonishing revelation of hidden connections. It ties
together everything from basic arithmetic to compound interest, the
circumference of a circle, trigonometry, calculus, and even infinity.
In David Stipp’s hands, Euler’s identity formula becomes a
contemplative stroll through the glories of mathematics.
The result is an ode to this magical field.
