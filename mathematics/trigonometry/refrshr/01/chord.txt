Chord Substitutions

As you look at this diagram, notice there are 3 boxes, movement is left to right, and follow the arrows to C or Gb. Why Gb? It’s the tritone sub of C, so you can resolve to it instead of C (chord sub rule #1). The two boxes on the left are mutually exclusive, use one or the other to start the progression, either the V of V box or the V of ii box, and you may start with the either the top or the bottom set (the substitutions). Notice how the chart shows Fourth-wise progression (and their subs). Five of the General Chord Progression rules are shown in the boxes. NOTE: In each box, you may omit any of the iim7 (or the sub iim7), or minor, chords. For example: D7 G7 C or D7 Dm7 G7 C instead of Am7 D7 Dm7 G7 C.

Moving backwards on the diagram from C/Gb is the “V” box, meaning the Dominant (the “V”) of C/Gb. Notice the last chords in that box before C/Gb is G7, the V of C, and Db7, the V of Gb. Leading to the G7/Db7 is its V, in this case minor 7. Dm7 resolves to G7, but also the tritone sub of G7, Db7. And vice-versa for Abm7.

Notice in the chart the classic jazz progression Am7 D7 Dm7 G7 C (called ii-V-ii-V-I or vi-II7-ii-V-I). Also notice another popular jazz progression Em7 A7 Dm7 G7 C, which is iii-VI7-ii-V-I.

The familiar jazz progression of ii-V-I is obvious in the middle box, as is its subs, the Abm7 for Dm7 and Db7 for the G7. Notice that they are b5 subs? The question of how do you get to the ii is answered by 1 of the 2 boxes on the left.

The options are playing the V of either the ii or the V, and starting with the ii of that V.

You can get to the “V” box one of two ways, EITHER the V of V chord, or the V of ii chord.

The “V of ii” box means that A7 is the V of the ii (Dm7) chord in the key of C, or A7 Dm7 G7 C.

In the “V of V” box, D7 is the V of the V (G7) in the key of C. Both boxes are equally valid routes to get to C.

Remember the cadences from Page 1? Notice them now on the right half in the diagram above.

Within each box is the chord leading to a Dominant. Follow the arrows. As the boxes are written, there are 64 possible chord progressions ((4x4x2)+(4x4x2)=64). Combined with rules #6, 7, 8 on Page 4, there are 3,584 possible chord progressions just in that one set of 3 boxes and their resolution to C or Gb! That’s 3,584 possibilities from only 5 chords. Some chords and progressions will sound dramatically better than others, of course, and some will sound much worse, but still... 3,584 is alot of possibilities from a 5-chord progression.

Each chord progression path in the chart represents a single rule for chord subs. Therefore it shows 64 rules, with little overlap with the 43 rules above.
