Mathematical Proofs: A Transition to Advanced Mathematics, Third Edition,
prepares students for the more abstract mathematics courses that follow calculus.
Appropriate for self-study or for use in the classroom, this text introduces students
to proof techniques, analyzing proofs, and writing proofs of their own. Written in a
clear, conversational style, this book provides a solid introduction to such topics as
relations, functions, and cardinalities of sets, as well as the theoretical aspects of
fields such as number theory, abstract algebra, and group theory. It is also a great
reference text that students can look back to when writing or reading proofs in their
more advanced courses.
