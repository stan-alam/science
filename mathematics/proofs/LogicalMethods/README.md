is about discovering patterns, uncovering hidden structures, finding counterexamples, and thinking logically. 
Mathematics is a way of thinking. It is an activity that is both highly creative and challenging.**

	* What is a proof? What is a counterexample?
	* What does it mean to say that something follows logically from a set of premises?
	* What does it mean to abstract over something?
	* How can knowledge and information be represented and used in calculations?
