Fermat's Last Theorem

MATHEMATICAL REVIEWS
```
"The history of elementary approaches to Fermat is very rich indeed, and Ribenboim 
has arranged these approaches in a way that makes them accessible to interested readers 
without extensive mathematical backgrounds…both readable and fairly comprehensive. 
This book would likely be of great interest to an enthusiastic undergraduate with a basic 
knowledge of rings and fields. In addition to describing the history of one of the great problems 
in number theory, the book provides a gentle and well-motivated introduction to some important 
ideas in modern number theory…any reader who spends a few hours with this book is guaranteed to learn 
something new and interesting about Fermat’s last theorem."
