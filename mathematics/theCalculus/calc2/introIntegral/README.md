5. Why is calc more difficult to understand than Algebra or Trig ?

6.  Are there any problems faced in our day-to-day life that can be solved more easily by Calculus than by arithmetic or algebra?

7. Are there problems that can be solved without Calculus?

8. Why study calculus?

9. Is Calculus different from other branches of mathematics ?

10. What type of problems are handled by Calculus ?


**The word calculus is taken from Latin to mean a "stone", "pebble" used by the romans to assist in counting**


    "By extending the meaning of the
    word “Calculus”, it is now applied to wider fields (of calculation) which involve processes
    other than mere counting. In the context of this book (with the discussion to follow), the word
    “Calculus” is an abbreviation for Infinitesimal Calculus or to one of its two separate but
    complimentary branches—Differential Calculus and Integral Calculus."...

    "Calculus is a higher branch of mathematics, which enters into the process of calculating
    changing quantities (and certain properties), in the field of mathematics and various branches of
    science, including social science. It is called Mathematics of Change."

**What is change and how does it change?**
