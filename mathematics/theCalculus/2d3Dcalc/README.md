From the Inside Flap
Covers multivariable calculus, starting from the basics and leading up to the three theorems of Green, Gauss, and Stokes, but always with an eye on practical applications.

Written for a wide spectrum of undergraduate students by an experienced author, this book provides a very practical approach to advanced calculus—starting from the basics and leading up to the theorems of Green, Gauss, and Stokes. It explains, clearly and concisely, partial differentiation, multiple integration, vectors and vector calculus, and provides end-of-chapter exercises along with their solutions to aid the readers' understanding.

Written in an approachable style and filled with numerous illustrative examples throughout, Two and Three Dimensional Calculus: with Applications in Science and Engineering assumes no prior knowledge of partial differentiation or vectors and explains difficult concepts with easy to follow examples. Rather than concentrating on mathematical structures, the book describes the development of techniques through their use in science and engineering so that students acquire skills that enable them to be used in a wide variety of practical situations. It also has enough rigour to enable those who wish to investigate the more mathematical generalizations found in most mathematics degrees to do so.

Assumes no prior knowledge of partial differentiation, multiple integration or vectors
Includes easy-to-follow examples throughout to help explain difficult concepts
Features end-of-chapter exercises with solutions

Two and Three Dimensional Calculus: with Applications in Science and Engineering is an ideal textbook for undergraduate students of engineering and applied sciences as well as those needing to use these methods for real problems in industry and commerce.
