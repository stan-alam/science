## Learn General Relativity by exploring the properties of a BlackHole.

an exposition of General Relatively accessible through high school calculus
Not using metric tensors.

Complete this book as an introduction to GR along with light GR (without calculus), latter for conceptual framework
and then move on to "the real" stuff.

This will enrich efforts to understand General Relativity through the extreme conditions of the area around a BlackHole, and the mathematical singularity
that arises from such curving of geometry. A singularity has not yet been observed in nature. And may only exist as result of the mathematics in GR.
