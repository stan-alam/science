## notes on 'Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!'' 

```text
Richard Feynman, winner of the Nobel Prize in physics, thrived on outrageous adventures.
Here he recounts in his inimitable voice his experience trading ideas on atomic physics
with Einstein and Bohr and ideas on gambling with Nick the Greek; cracking the uncrackable
safes guarding the most deeply held nuclear secrets; accompanying a ballet on his bongo drums;
painting a naked female toreador. In short, here is Feynman’s life in all its eccentric—a
combustible mixture of high intelligence, unlimited curiosity, and raging chutzpah.
Black-and-white photographs throughout.

History will remember Nobel Prize–winning physicist Feynman (1918–1988), for his work
in quantum physics and his role in the investigation of the explosion of the Challenger
space shuttle. Contemporary readers and listeners, however, will remember him best for his
reputation as a free-thinking iconoclast whose personal adventures were hilarious,
insightful and inspiring. Todd does a fabulous job of conveying Feynman’s infectious
enthusiasm and childlike sense of wonder with his energetic portrayal of the scientist.
He’s adept even in difficult sections, such as when Feynman “speaks Italian” and
“Chinese”—inventing completely made-up but accurate sounding languages. Todd does a
good job of portraying Feynman’s inquisitive manner and conveys the book’s message and
attitude with aplomb. While he sounds nothing like the late physicist (Feynman— the subject
of James Gleick’s Genius—had a thick Long Island accent and sounded more like a cross
between Yogi Bear and The Honeymooners’ Ed Norton), Todd’s clean, polite voice is a
revelation. ~ Publisher Weekly
