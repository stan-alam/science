## notes on 'Beyond Weird'

```text
Since Niels Bohr said this many years ago, quantum mechanics has only
been getting more shocking. We now realize that it’s not really telling us
that “weird” things happen out of sight, on the tiniest level, in the atomic
world: rather, everything is quantum. But if quantum mechanics is correct,
what seems obvious and right in our everyday world is built on foundations that
don’t seem obvious or right at all—or even possible.

An exhilarating tour of the contemporary quantum landscape, Beyond Weird is a
book about what quantum physics really means—and what it doesn’t. Science writer
Philip Ball offers an up-to-date, accessible account of the quest to come to grips
with the most fundamental theory of physical reality, and to explain how its
counterintuitive principles underpin the world we experience. Over the past
decade it has become clear that quantum physics is less a theory about particles
and waves, uncertainty and fuzziness, than a theory about information and
knowledge—about what can be known, and how we can know it.  Discoveries and
experiments over the past few decades have called into question the meanings and
limits of space and time, cause and effect, and, ultimately, of knowledge itself.
The quantum world Ball shows us isn’t a different world. It is our world, and if
anything deserves to be called “weird,” it’s us.
