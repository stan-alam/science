## notes on Warped.

```text
The universe has many secrets. It may hide additional dimensions of space other than the familiar
three we recognize. There might even be another universe adjacent to ours, invisible and unattainable . . .
 for now.

Warped Passages is a brilliantly readable and altogether exhilarating journey that tracks the arc of
discovery from early twentieth-century physics to the razor’s edge of modern scientific theory. One of
 the world’s leading theoretical physicists, Lisa Randall provides astonishing scientific possibilities
 that, until recently, were restricted to the realm of science fiction. Unraveling the twisted threads of
 the most current debates on relativity, quantum mechanics, and gravity, she explores some of the most
 fundamental questions posed by Nature—taking us into the warped, hidden dimensions underpinning the
 universe we live in, demystifying the science of the myriad worlds that may exist just beyond our own.

The concept of additional spatial dimensions is as far from intuitive as any idea can be. Indeed,
although Harvard physicist Randall does a very nice job of explaining—often deftly through the use of
creative analogies—how our universe may have many unseen dimensions, readers’ heads are likely to be
swimming by the end of the book. Randall works hard to make her astoundingly complex material
understandable, providing a great deal of background for recent advances in string and supersymmetry
theory. As coauthor of the two most important scientific papers on this topic, she’s ideally suited to
popularize the idea. What is absolutely clear is that physicists simply do not yet know if there are extra
dimensions a fraction of a millimeter in size, dimensions of infinite size or only the dimensions we see.
What’s also clear is that the large hadron collider, the world’s most powerful tool for studying subatomic
particles, is likely to provide information permitting scientists to differentiate among these ideas soon
after it begins operation in Switzerland in 2007. Randall brings much of the excitement of her field to
life as she describes her quest to understand the structure of the universe
