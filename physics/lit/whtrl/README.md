## notes on 'What is real'

```text
Every physicist agrees quantum mechanics is among humanity’s finest scientific achievements.
But ask what it means, and the result will be a brawl. For a century, most physicists have
followed Niels Bohr’s Copenhagen interpretation and dismissed questions about the reality
underlying quantum physics as meaningless. A mishmash of solipsism and poor reasoning,
Copenhagen endured, as Bohr’s students vigorously protected his legacy, and the physics
community favored practical experiments over philosophical arguments. As a result, questioning the
status quo long meant professional ruin. And yet, from the 1920s to today, physicists like John Bell,
David Bohm, and Hugh Everett persisted in seeking the true meaning of quantum mechanics.
What Is Real? is the gripping story of this battle of ideas and the courageous scientists
who dared to stand up for truth.

“Splendid…. With deeply detailed research, accompanied by charming anecdotes about the
scientists…[Becker] hopes to convince us that the Cophenhagen interpretation has had too
great an influence on physics for historically contingent reasons.”―Washington Post
