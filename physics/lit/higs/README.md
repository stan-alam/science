## notes on the higgs

```text
On July 4, 2012, physicists at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva made history when they
discovered an entirely new type of subatomic particle that many scientists believe is the
Higgs boson. For forty years, physicists searched for this capstone to the Standard Model
of particle physics—the theory that describes both the most elementary components that are
known in matter and the forces through which they interact. This particle points to the
Higgs field, which provides the key to understanding why elementary particles have mass.
In Higgs Discovery, Lisa Randall explains the science behind this monumental discovery,
its exhilarating implications, and the power of empty space.
“A lucid, deft and engaging summation of dogged determination and "heroic engineering."
