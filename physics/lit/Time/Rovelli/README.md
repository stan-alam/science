## Time

Notes on The Order of
Time, **Carlo Rovelli**

```text
Why do we remember the past and not the future? What does it mean for time to 
“flow”? Do we exist in time or does time exist in us? In lyric, accessible
prose, Carlo Rovelli invites us to consider questions about the nature of
time that continue to puzzle physicists and philosophers alike.

For most readers this is unfamiliar terrain. We all experience time, but
the more scientists learn about it, the more mysterious it remains. We think
of it as uniform and universal, moving steadily from past to future, measured
by clocks. Rovelli tears down these assumptions one by one, revealing a
strange universe where at the most fundamental level time disappears. He
explains how the theory of quantum gravity attempts to understand and give
meaning to the resulting extreme landscape of this timeless world.
Weaving together ideas from philosophy, science and literature,
he suggests that our perception of the flow of time depends on
our perspective, better understood starting from the structure
of our brain and emotions than from the physical universe.

Already a bestseller in Italy, and written with the poetic vitality
that made Seven Brief Lessons on Physicsso appealing, The Order of
Time offers a profoundly intelligent, culturally rich,
novel appreciation of the mysteries of time.
