White Holes

	 It is because disequilibrium is so necessary to thinking that it is so natural to us to think of time as directional, and so difficult to accept the idea that the orientation of time is not fundamental.

This, in the end, is the answer to the question of why it is so difficult for us to accept the idea of a nature that is not oriented in time—because our very thinking is itself a child of the orientation of time. It is itself one of the products of the initial disequilibrium.
			 We always make the mistake of thinking of ourselves as different from the world around us, of thinking that we are looking at it from the outside. We forget that we are like other things—that we, too, are like the things we look at.
			 For this reason, every investigation of things ends up closely involving ourselves.

When we seek to understand white holes, we do so not as pure reason, not as part of a world different from the objects that we are trying to understand. We are processes guided by the same stars.

this interweaving of correlations—between the endless richness of our individual and collective memory, and the fabulous richness of the structure of reality—is itself an indirect product of the equilibration of things in time.

Note: 04

we, creatures of thought and of emotion, are this interweaving that is formed at the macroscopic level between ourselves and the world. we are not just social beings who live on relationships with other human beings, and biochemical organisms that burn free energy from the sun, in common with the rest of the biosphere. we are also animals endowed with neurons that are interwoven, thanks to these correlations, with other parts of reality.
			 we are as curious as cats about everything. even about white holes. it is in our nature to “go and see.” to call this “curiosity,

	 when dante in paradise interrogates beatrice on questions of doctrine, is he really motivated by doctrinal questions? rather, isn’t the objective to get to the point where Beatrice gazes upon me with her eyes Full of the sparks of love, and so divine, That, overcome my power, I turned my back And almost lost myself with eyes downcast?[*]
			 the same, i think, goes for the world. to study space, time, black holes and white holes is a way of us being in relation to reality. a reality that is not “it,” but “you”—as lyric poets have it when
