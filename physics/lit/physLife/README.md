## notes on the 'Physics of Life'

```text
The Physics of Life explores the roots of the big question by examining the deepest
urges and properties of living things, both animate and inanimate: how to live longer,
with food, warmth, power, movement and free access to other people and surroundings.
Bejan explores controversial and relevant issues such as sustainability, water and
food supply, fuel, and economy, to critique the state in which the world understands
positions of power and freedom. Breaking down concepts such as desire and power,
sports health and culture, the state of economy, water and energy, politics and
distribution, Bejan uses the language of physics to explain how each system works in order
to clarify the meaning of evolution in its broadest scientific sense, moving the reader
towards a better understanding of the world’s systems and the natural evolution of cultural
and political development.

The Physics of Life argues that the evolution phenomenon is much broader and older than the
evolutionary designs that constitute the biosphere, empowering readers with a new view of the
globe and the future, revealing that the urge to have better ideas has the same physical
effect as the urge to have better laws and better government. This is evolution explained
loudly but also elegantly, forging a path that flows sustainability.

“In this quirky, occasionally ingenious work, Bejan explores evolution as a phenomenon not
of biology but of physics.” ―Publisher’s
