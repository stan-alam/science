They did not play by the rules, but rather they tried to co-opt the meeting and force everyone else to play their game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

We think in words, and our words mirror the world. But for Einstein, thinking was never a linguistic endeavor. Language may be necessary for communication of our thoughts to others, but he thought it stood in the way of connecting ourselves to the world itself and to the world of our own mind. “For me it is not dubious that our thinking goes on for the most part without use of signs (words) and beyond that to a considerable degree unconsciously. For how otherwise should it happen that sometimes we ‘wonder’ quite spontaneously about experience? This ‘wondering’ seems to occur when an experience comes into conflict with a world of concepts which is already sufficiently fixed within us.”5 Words and concepts were not to be trusted, as they took us away from the real world and our real experiences within it. We needed to return to our world of wonder, which puts us in touch with our inner images and not the abstract artificial concepts we use to categorize them. Images were one avenue to a direct link, and Einstein’s science would always have a very visual, pictorial sense to it full of thought experiments, models, and metaphors. But another nonlinguistic way of connecting to the real elements of the universe is music. For Einstein, whether through performance or listening, music brought an experience of unification, connection, and order that did|

It would not be exaggeration to say that Einstein thought music to be spiritual in the deepest sense.

Is it possible that Einstein had Asperger’s? Of course, but there is not convincing evidence to support the postmortem diagnosis. We do have evidence, however, to dispel the claim that Einstein failed mathematics in school or that he was not accomplished at mathematics as a child. From his report cards to glowing mentions in his mother’s correspondences, we know that Einstein’s grades, especially in math and science, were almost always at the top of his class. Einstein himself reports his extensive independent forays into the realm of mathematical thought during high school. “At the age of 12–16 I familiarized myself with the elements of mathematics together with the principles of differential and integral calculus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Einstein studied hard with Grossmann, and as a result they finished first and second in their class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Today, if you want a Ph.D., you need to be accepted into a graduate program and satisfy a program of study that includes coursework, exams, and a dissertation process under an adviser resulting in research that expands the field. In Einstein’s time, things were less formal and students submitted their work to university faculty, who then determined whether it was novel and important enough to merit the degree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Working in Weber’s lab, he explored the thermoelectric Thomson effect.2 When wires of different materials are connected and electrical current is sent through them, the wires heat up to different temperatures. This did not seem too odd, but more surprisingly, the effect works in the other direction—that is, by heating wires made of different materials joined together one can actually generate electricity. Exploring this connection between heat and electricity was classic Einstein, as he loved looking for insights in the relations between seemingly different subfields of physics. But in 1900, when he first began working toward a doctorate, the effort fell flat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Einstein did and was able to recover the 230 franc fee that he had to pay as part of the dissertation submission process, but as a result he became quite bitter. For a while, Einstein put aside the idea of getting a Ph.D., but then he realized that it would be both useful if he stayed at the patent office and essential if he was to continue pursuing an academic post.

The measurable quantities of volume, pressure, and temperature had long been related to each other, and in a series of famous papers in the mid-nineteenth century James Clerk Maxwell figured out how to think of them in terms of large collections of microscopic molecules. If gases were really just a bunch of disconnected molecules in motion, then pressure would be the result of the particles bouncing off the wall of the container in which they were held. Since heat adds energy, higher temperature could be thought of as increasing the average speed of the molecules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

This law makes sense to us intuitively.

Take a cup of tea and add a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar melts from solid crystals to a viscous liquid that distributes itself through the tea so that after a while every sip has roughly the same sweetness. Liquid flows, so it seems that it is not a set of solid, discrete molecules but rather is something smooth. Einstein set out to show that this smooth liquid really was made up of individual bits by considering how the liquid sugar distributes itself throughout the teacup. To do this, Einstein makes assumptions similar to Maxwell’s—that is, assume that (1) the sugar molecules are spherical, and (2) the sugar molecules are so much larger than the molecules of the liquid that from the perspective of larger sugar molecules the tea molecules can be seen as smoothly surrounding them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The larger particles are surrounded by many tiny molecules bouncing off of them. But since the liquid around them is composed of molecules all moving in various directions, on average the molecular collisions from one side of the large particles would most likely be balanced out by the collisions from the molecules on the other side. Only if you had a significantly greater number of collisions from one side than from the other would enough force be generated to cause the large particles to move.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

How could one mathematically model this situation? Einstein realized that he recently had done just that. In his doctoral dissertation, he treated the molecules of dissolved sugar as larger spheres surrounded by a sea of liquid. That is exactly what was happening in this case. Einstein could use the same exact mathematical moves from his dissertation and apply them to Brownian motion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

At the same time, there is little doubt in Einstein’s mind that what he is describing is Brownian motion. This makes the challenge in the second paragraph something of a sucker’s bet. Einstein sets out observation of the motion that he “predicts” will occur as something philosophers of science call a “crucial experiment”—that is, a result that if observed will justify a theory, and if not observed will falsify it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Since this is a displacement that was within the possibility of being observed in the lab, though not easily, Einstein concludes with: “Let us hope that a researcher will soon succeed in solving the problems posed here, which is of such importance in the theory of heat!”9 The use of exclamation points is not common in scientific papers, and it shows both Einstein’s sense of the importance of his work and his lack of concern with the usual marks of professionalism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Perrin, with Einstein, was a strong proponent of the atomic theory and, also in line with Einstein, a prolific calculator of Avogadro’s number. They both spent much time collecting radically different sorts of phenomena from across the spectrum of subfields in physics, all of which could be used to calculate Avogadro’s number. Since Avogadro’s number is the number of atoms in a fixed amount of a substance, each approach must give independent and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

In these cases, light behaves as a wave. Maxwell’s equations, the four laws that govern electromagnetism, are named for James Clerk Maxwell, who discovered none of them and in fact made just one change to one term in one equation. But when Maxwell took these individual principles and put them together into a coherent, unified theory, they became incredibly powerful. One of the unexpected results was that these equations, which describe the behavior of electricity and magnetism, could also be used to describe the behavior of light.

He found that we could account for blackbody radiation if we think of light as emitted and absorbed not as waves but as individual packets, as particles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Convinced that the atomic hypothesis was wrong, that matter is continuous and light is a smooth wave, he held that nature could not come in bits. But here was his finding, and so he declared that we needed to think of light as if it was absorbed and emitted in discrete clumps. While it was traveling, the wave description worked perfectly, but to avoid the ultraviolet catastrophe we would treat light as if it were made up of particles when it is given off or taken in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
