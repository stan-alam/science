They did not play by the rules, but rather they tried to co-opt the meeting and force everyone else to play their game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The teachings of Jesus, with their emphasis on love and care for those who are vulnerable, stood in stark contrast to the larger cultural messages he received from not only the school but the regular military parades that he loathed even as a child.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

We think in words, and our words mirror the world. But for Einstein, thinking was never a linguistic endeavor. Language may be necessary for communication of our thoughts to others, but he thought it stood in the way of connecting ourselves to the world itself and to the world of our own mind. “For me it is not dubious that our thinking goes on for the most part without use of signs (words) and beyond that to a considerable degree unconsciously. For how otherwise should it happen that sometimes we ‘wonder’ quite spontaneously about experience? This ‘wondering’ seems to occur when an experience comes into conflict with a world of concepts which is already sufficiently fixed within us.”5 Words and concepts were not to be trusted, as they took us away from the real world and our real experiences within it. We needed to return to our world of wonder, which puts us in touch with our inner images and not the abstract artificial concepts we use to categorize them. Images were one avenue to a direct link, and Einstein’s science would always have a very visual, pictorial sense to it full of thought experiments, models, and metaphors. But another nonlinguistic way of connecting to the real elements of the universe is music. For Einstein, whether through performance or listening, music brought an experience of unification, connection, and order that did|

It would not be exaggeration to say that Einstein thought music to be spiritual in the deepest sense.

Is it possible that Einstein had Asperger’s? Of course, but there is not convincing evidence to support the postmortem diagnosis. We do have evidence, however, to dispel the claim that Einstein failed mathematics in school or that he was not accomplished at mathematics as a child. From his report cards to glowing mentions in his mother’s correspondences, we know that Einstein’s grades, especially in math and science, were almost always at the top of his class. Einstein himself reports his extensive independent forays into the realm of mathematical thought during high school. “At the age of 12–16 I familiarized myself with the elements of mathematics together with the principles of differential and integral calculus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

It was the first—but certainly not the last—time Grossmann bailed Einstein out of a tough situation that he created for himself out of arrogance. Einstein studied hard with Grossmann, and as a result they finished first and second in their class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

So the period before a scientific revolution is very uncomfortable for those in the field who are compelled to think philosophically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |


The commonly held view of Albert Einstein is of an eccentric genius for whom the pursuit of science was everything. But in actuality, the brilliant innovator whose Theory of Relativity forever reshaped our understanding of time was a man of his times, always politically engaged and driven by strong moral principles. An avowed pacifist, Einstein’s mistrust of authority and outspoken social and scientific views earned him death threats from Nazi sympathizers in the years preceding World War II. To him, science provided not only a means for understanding the behavior of the universe, but a foundation for considering the deeper questions of life and a way for the worldwide Jewish community to gain confidence and pride in itself.

Steven Gimbel’s biography presents Einstein in the context of the world he lived in, offering a fascinating portrait of a remarkable individual who remained actively engaged in international affairs throughout his life. This revealing work not only explains Einstein’s theories in understandable terms, it demonstrates how they directly emerged from the realities of his times and helped create the world we live in today.
