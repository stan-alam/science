## notes on 'Equation of Life'

```text
We are all familiar with the popular idea of strange alien life wildly different
from life on earth inhabiting other planets. Maybe it’s made of silicon! Maybe it
has wheels! Or maybe it doesn’t. In The Equations of Life, biologist Charles S.
Cockell makes the forceful argument that the laws of physics narrowly constrain
how life can evolve, making evolution’s outcomes predictable. If we were to find
on a distant planet something very much like a lady bug eating something like an
aphid, we shouldn’t be surprised. The forms of life are guided by a limited
set of rules, and as a result, there is a narrow set of solutions to the challenges
of existence.
A remarkable scientific contribution breathing new life into Darwin’s theory
of evolution, The Equations of Life makes a radical argument about what life
can–and can’t–be.
