"Quantum computing is important because the universe is a fundamentally quantum place.
We have had great success over the past century building computing systems that allow us
to model, simulate, analyze and interpret the world around us. However, as those computing
systems have been based on classic logic, they are limited that they can only efficiently
model a universe that approximates a classic one. We know, with astounding precision that
the universe in which we exist is fundamentally quantum. And so in order to understand the
universe as it actually exists, we must use a quantum representation. We do not know for
sure if our own universe is itself a simulation. But we can say that if it is, it's running
on a quantum computer. â€“ Aaron Van Devender, PhD; Chief Scientist, Founders Fund
