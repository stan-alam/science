## notes on 'QC for everyone'

The aim of this book is to give an introduction to quantum computing that
anyone who is comfortable with high school mathematics and is willing
to put in a little work can understand. We will study qubits, entanglement,
quantum teleportation, and quantum algorithms, among other quantumrelated
topics. The goal is not to give some vague idea of these concepts but
to make them crystal clear.
Quantum computing is often in the news: China teleported a qubit
from earth to a satellite; Shor’s algorithm has put our current encryption
methods at risk; quantum key distribution will make encryption safe again;
Grover’s algorithm will speed up data searches. But what does all this really
mean? How does it all work? All of this will be explained.
