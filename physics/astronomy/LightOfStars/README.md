## Notes on Light of the Stars

```text

Light of the Stars tells the story of humanity’s coming of age as we awaken to
the possibilities of life on other worlds and their sudden relevance to our fate
 on Earth. Astrophysicist Adam Frank traces the question of alien life and
 intelligence from the ancient Greeks to the leading thinkers of our own time,
 and shows how we as a civilization can only hope to survive climate change if
 we recognize what science has recently discovered: that we are just one of
 ten billion trillion planets in the Universe, and it’s highly likely that many
 of those planets hosted technologically advanced alien civilizations. What’s
 more, each of those civilizations must have faced the same challenge of
 civilization-driven climate change.

Written with great clarity and conviction, Light of the Stars builds on the
inspiring work of pioneering scientists such as Frank Drake and Carl Sagan,
whose work at the dawn of the space age began building the new science of
astrobiology; Jack James, the Texas-born engineer who drove NASA’s first
planetary missions to success; Vladimir Vernadsky, the Russian geochemist
who first envisioned the Earth’s biosphere; and James Lovelock and
Lynn Margulis, who invented Gaia theory. Frank recounts the perilous journey
NASA undertook across millions of miles of deep space to get its probes to
Venus and Mars, yielding our first view of the cosmic laws of planets and
climate that changed our understanding of our place in the universe.
