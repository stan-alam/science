## notes on 'Death by Blackhole'

```text
Loyal readers of the monthly “Universe” essays in Natural History magazine have long
recognized Neil deGrasse Tyson’s talent for guiding them through the mysteries of the
cosmos with clarity and enthusiasm. Bringing together more than forty of Tyson’s favorite
essays, ?Death by Black Hole? explores a myriad of cosmic topics, from what it would be
like to be inside a black hole to the movie industry’s feeble efforts to get its night skies
right. One of America’s best-known astrophysicists, Tyson is a natural teacher who simplifies
the complexities of astrophysics while sharing his infectious fascination for our universe.

What would it feel like if your spaceship were to venture too close to the black hole
lurking at the center of the Milky Way? According to astrophysicist Tyson, director of
New York City’s Hayden Planetarium, size does matter when it comes to black holes, although
the chances of your surviving the encounter aren’t good in any case. Tyson takes readers on an
exciting journey from Earth’s hot springs, where extremophiles flourish in hellish conditions,
to the frozen, desolate stretches of the Oort Cloud and the universe’s farthest reaches, in both
space and time. Tyson doesn’t restrict his musings to astrophysics, but wanders into related
fields like relativity and particle physics, which he explains just as clearly as he does Lagrangian
points, where we someday may park interplanetary filling stations. He tackles popular myths
(is the sun yellow?) and takes movie directors—most notably James Cameron—to task for spectacular goofs.
In the last section the author gives his take on the hot subject of intelligent design. Readers of Natural
History magazine will be familiar with many of the 42 essays collected here, while newcomers will profit
from Tyson’s witty and entertaining description of being pulled apart atom by atom into a black hole,
and other, closer-to-earth, and cheerier, topics. ~ Publisher Weekly
