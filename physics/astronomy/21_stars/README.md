The History of Our Universe in 21 Stars: (That you can Spot in the Night Sky)



Pick up a half-decent pair of binoculars, and the number of stars in your sky will instantly leap to more than a hundred thousand. A small telescope raises that number to 2.5 million plus – enough to keep the most obsessive stargazer busy for several lifetimes. But even these are just the tip of the cosmic iceberg. Our best estimates suggest that the Milky Way galaxy (the vast stellar disc we call home), contains perhaps 400 billion stars in all, with six or seven more sparking into life each year. And then you can square that figure of 400 billion, since there are at least as many galaxies in the Universe as there are stars in the Milky Way.

Although each star is a unique case study, they all go through similar phases in a cycle of life and death, shine by the same basic processes, and tend to group together in distinct categories – so what’s true for one star will be more or less true for billions of others.

 The stars we’ll be visiting in the following pages were picked for a variety of reasons. In some cases – like 61 Cygni and Sirius B – they’ve played a unique role in the discovery of our place in the Universe.

Astronomy is both the oldest of the sciences, and the most engaging, for one very good reason: its accessibility. Any one of us can go out tonight and experience light rays from a distant star, ending a journey that may have begun thousands of years ago by striking the back of our retina and triggering a spark in our optic nerve.
